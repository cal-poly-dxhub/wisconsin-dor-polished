      "Q": "Is agricultural forest a separate class or a subclass of undeveloped land?",
      "A": "Agricultural forest (class 5m) is a separate property class and is not a subclass of undeveloped land (class 5)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do the agricultural forest and/or undeveloped land classes have any impact on the assessor's class comparisons for assessment compliance purposes?",
      "A": "Yes. For assessment compliance purposes, under state law (sec. \u301010\u202070.05\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.) the assessed values of undeveloped land (class 5), agricultural forest (class 5m), productive forest (class 6), and other (class 7) are combined."

      "Q": "If Mary Smith owns a parcel that is wholly agricultural land and Mary's spouse John Smith owns an adjacent parcel with forest land contiguous to the agricultural parcel, is the forest land owned by John Smith classified as agricultural forest?",
      "A": "Yes. Under Wisconsin's marital property law (ch. \u301010\u2020766\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), the legal title of both parcels is held by both spouses. Therefore, the forest land is properly classified as agricultural forest."

    {
      "Q": "Farmer Smith owns a parcel that is wholly agricultural and Farmer Smith and Farmer Johnson own an adjoining wooded parcel. Is the wooded parcel considered agricultural forest even though two different names appear on the deeds?",
      "A": "No. Since there are two separate owners, the wooded parcel does not qualify as agricultural forest classification."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In the following example, is the ownership situation considered the same owner? Example: Dennis Johnson owns a parcel that is wholly agricultural and Cedar View Farms (owned by Dennis Johnson) owns an adjoining wooded parcel, but the properties are titled differently.",
      "A": "If Cedar View Farms:\n- Is a legal entity (ex: corporation) \u2013 the contiguous parcels are not owned by the same entity\n- Is not a legal entity and both parcels are deeded to Dennis Johnson \u2013 both parcels are owned by the same entity"

    {
      "Q": "How does state law define agricultural forest?",
      "A": "Under state law (sec. \u301010\u202070.32(2)(c)1d\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), effective since January 1, 2005, agricultural forest is land producing or capable of producing commercial forest products if the land satisfies any of the following conditions:\n1. It is contiguous to a parcel classified in whole as agricultural, if the contiguous parcel is owned by the same person who owns the land that is producing or capable of producing commercial forest products. In this subdivision, \"contiguous\" includes separated only by a road. (Review Qs 2-9.)\n2. It is located on a parcel that contains land classified as agricultural in the property tax assessment on January 1, 2004, and on January 1 of the year of assessment. (Review Qs 11-12.)\n3. It is located on a parcel where at least 50% of the acreage was converted to land classified as agricultural in the property tax assessment on January 1, 2005, or thereafter. (Review Qs 13-15.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What classifies a parcel in whole as agricultural?",
      "A": "A wholly agricultural parcel is one the assessor classified entirely as agricultural (class 4) in the assessment roll. (Note: Review Q 6 below for the one exception to this.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does forest land qualify as agricultural forest if the forest acres are contiguous to a wholly agricultural parcel?",
      "A": "Yes. It qualifies if the contiguous forest land has the same owner as the wholly agricultural parcel."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the qualifying agricultural forest parcel need to be completely forested?",
      "A": "No. However, the forested acres must be contiguous to the wholly agricultural parcel to qualify as agricultural forest."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can an owner have qualifying agricultural forest acres in more than one parcel?",
      "A": "Yes. However, the contiguous forest land must be in the parcel or parcels contiguous to the wholly agricultural parcel."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a parcel containing 39 acres of agricultural (class 4) land and one acre of road right-of-way (ROW) (class 5) considered a wholly agricultural parcel?",
      "A": "Yes. DOR considers the parcel as described a wholly agricultural parcel. Any acres listed as road ROW do not disqualify the parcel."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If there are parcels touching at only one point, are they considered contiguous parcels?",
      "A": "Yes. Parcels touching at only one point are contiguous."

      "Q": "In some cases, the assessment roll may combine two forties (or several forties) under one parcel number. Are the combined forties considered a parcel?",
      "A": "*(Content for this Q is not explicitly provided in the source, but likely covered under DOR guidelines.)*"

    {
      "Q": "Is the following parcel considered wholly agricultural? A forty with a classification of 40 acres of agricultural (class 4) and an improvement assessment of $5,000 for a well (other class 7) improvement. There are no site acres (other class 7) land included for this parcel.",
      "A": "*(A content implied by context: Yes, the parcel is considered wholly agricultural because the well improvement does not disqualify the classification as long as the land use is agricultural.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If forest land adjoins Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land, is the forest land considered agricultural forest?",
      "A": "*(Likely A: Yes, if the adjoining CRP land is agricultural, forest land contiguous to it owned by the same owner would qualify as agricultural forest.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do forest acres located within a parcel also containing agricultural land qualify as agricultural forest acres?",
      "A": "*(Likely A: Yes, forest acres within a parcel that also has agricultural land can qualify as agricultural forest if they meet the conditions of being contiguous to or part of an agricultural parcel.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is there a minimum number of agricultural or forest acres required to qualify as agricultural forest?",
      "A": "*(Likely A: No specific minimum acreage; qualification depends on meeting contiguous ownership and land use conditions, not a set acreage.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a forest is in a parcel with multiple classifications, does it qualify for agricultural forest?",
      "A": "*(Likely A: It can, if the forest land meets the criteria under any of the qualifying conditions for agricultural forest in that parcel.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do the forested acres located in a parcel where land was converted to agricultural land qualify as agricultural forest?",
      "A": "*(Likely A: Yes, if at least 50% of the parcel was converted to agricultural land (per Condition c) the remaining forest acres in that parcel qualify as agricultural forest.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "In this example, do the 25 acres of forest qualify as agricultural forest for the current year? Example: A 40-acre parcel was classified as 40 acres of forest in 2004. In the current assessment year, 15 of these acres are classified as agricultural and 25 acres as forest land.",
      "A": "*(Likely A: Yes, the 25 acres of forest qualify as agricultural forest because they are part of a parcel where at least 50% was converted to agricultural use as of the current assessment year.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do the ROW acres classified as undeveloped land (class 5) affect the 50% acreage measurement?",
      "A": "ROW acres are included in agricultural land acres for measurement of the 50% threshold. For example, a 40-acre parcel with 19 acres of agricultural land, one acre of undeveloped land (ROW), and 20 acres of agricultural forest does meet the condition, since at least 50% of the parcel\u2019s total acreage is agricultural land."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does an assessor decide whether a split parcel or a combined parcel (i.e., two parcels legally joined as one) in the current assessment year qualifies for agricultural forest?",
      "A": "An assessor should use the same rules as those for newly created parcels with separate legal descriptions (split from their original parcel or combined parcels into one). Forest within the new parcels qualify for agricultural forest by:\n- Being contiguous to a wholly agricultural parcel with the same owner\n- Containing agricultural acres in 2004 and in the current assessment year (the agricultural acres for 2004 must be within the boundaries of the current parcel)\n- If no agricultural acres existed in 2004, but at least 50% of the acreage is converted to agriculture in the current assessment year"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do the guidelines for agricultural forest assessment adjustments apply to land enrolled in the Managed Forest Land (MFL) and Private Forest Crop (PFC) programs?",
      "A": "Yes. If any of the qualifications of agricultural forest are met, the values of land enrolled in MFL or PFC should be adjusted in the same manner as taxable forest property. If the contract is broken, penalties are collected based on what the taxes would have been if the land was not enrolled in the program. Therefore, assessments of land enrolled in MFL or PFC must be equitable with similar land not enrolled in those programs. The assessor must inform the property owner under state law (sec. \u301012\u202070.365\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.) of the assessment change."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In this example, what criteria should be used to determine if agricultural forest exists? Example: For 2004 a parcel's acreage was classified entirely as MFL; however, some acreage within the parcel was used for agricultural purposes. For the current assessment year, the parcel is no longer in MFL; however, the agricultural use continues.",
      "A": "MFL parcels receiving use value due to agricultural use are treated as if an agricultural classification exists. If an MFL parcel received agricultural use values in 2004, then in the current assessment year this parcel (whether remaining in MFL or not) qualifies for agricultural forest by having any amount of acreage devoted primarily to agricultural use."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do parcels separated only by a road remain contiguous to each other?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law (sec. \u301010\u202070.32(2)(c)1d\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), the term \"contiguous\" means separated only by a road."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does \"road\" as a boundary mean only federal, state, county, or town roads? Do private roads qualify as roads?",
      "A": "A road includes any public way. Therefore, a private road or driveway is not considered a road for purposes of administering this law."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a driveway used for a residence and farm buildings considered a road?",
      "A": "No. Driveways serving a residence and farm buildings (not dedicated to the municipality) are not considered a road for purposes of administering this law."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does railroad property owned by a railroad company, or railroad property containing a right-of-way, get treated in the same manner as roads?",
      "A": "No. Railroad property:\n- Owned by a railroad is private property with a separate owner and is not treated as a road\n- Railroad property having a right-of-way is not treated as a road"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are parcels owned by the same owner and separated by a municipal or county boundary considered contiguous?",
      "A": "Yes. Parcels separated by municipal or county boundaries are considered contiguous."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do road right-of-ways (ROWs) and fallow agricultural land belong in the undeveloped land class?",
      "A": "Yes. Road ROWs and fallow agricultural land are included in undeveloped land (class 5)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does all property included in undeveloped land (class 5) have to be assessed at 50%?",
      "A": "Yes. All property in undeveloped land (class 5) must be assessed at 50% of full value as determined under sec. \u301010\u202070.32(1)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does a sparsely-treed, cutover parcel classify as undeveloped land, instead of productive forest?",
      "A": "Generally, a sparsely-treed, cutover parcel is classified as productive forest land since its highest and best use is for forestry purposes. It is differentiated from undeveloped land (fallow) since fallow is generally in transition from agricultural use to its next biological succession, which is wooded growth."
    },
    {
      "Q": "At what point does a new tree plantation become forest? Would it be after two or three years or when the trees are Christmas tree height?",
      "A": "If the newly planted trees are not Christmas trees, orchards, or nursery stock, the land the trees are growing on is classified as productive forest and valued at market value the year after planting. If Christmas trees, orchards, or nursery stock were planted, the land under the trees is classified and valued according to its agricultural use value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do assessors distinguish between applying the residential class or the undeveloped land class when assessing smaller parcels of vacant land?",
      "A": "The \u301011\u2020Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual\u3011 states the residential class includes most property where the predominant use is for living purposes. It also includes vacant land where the most likely use would be residential development if the land in Q does not meet the definition of agricultural land. If the land\u2019s most likely use is residential and it isn\u2019t used for agriculture, it would be classified residential. If it meets the definition of agricultural use in the prior year, it would be undeveloped land."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How should an assessor value lands qualifying for the agricultural forest and undeveloped land classifications?",
      "A": "According to state law (sec. \u301010\u202070.32(4)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), assessments for agricultural forest and undeveloped land are valued at 50% of their full value as determined under sec. \u301011\u202070.32(1)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What does the term \"full value\" mean in state law (sec. 70.32(4), Wis. Stats.)?",
      "A": "Under state law, full value refers to its market value (sec. \u301012\u202070.32\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.). With a 50% valuation, an assessment must be at 50% of the municipality's average assessment level."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Should assessors adjust the values to 50% annually or should they make the adjustment when it occurs and again during a revaluation?",
      "A": "Assessors must make valuation adjustments for classification changes beginning with the 2004 assessment. Generally, assessors make valuation changes when conducting a revaluation. Assessors must follow state law (sec. \u301013\u202070.05\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.) that specifies assessment compliance. For compliance purposes, assessors must combine the values of undeveloped land, agricultural forest, productive forest, and other (e.g., agricultural home sites and improvements) as one class."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Since assessors generally do not determine assessments less than $100 increments and most computer systems do not accept less than $100 class entries, should the current $100 assessment on the one-acre right-of-way (class 5) remain $100?",
      "A": "Yes. There is no change to this."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the equalized value include agricultural forest and undeveloped land classifications at 50% of market value?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law (sec. \u301014\u202070.57(3)(b)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), the equalized value includes agricultural forest and undeveloped land at 50% of their full value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are the filing requirements for the AAR?",
      "A": "From 2014 to 2019, assessors were required to complete an AAR for each municipality where they were the assessor. Effective 2020, assessors are not required to complete an AAR. DOR will continue to provide an AAR template. Assessors and municipal officials must determine whether an AAR, or similar document, will assist with completion and communication of these items, and may consider this a contractual item."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why would a municipality require an assessor to complete an AAR?",
      "A": "Assessors use the AAR to develop, communicate, and report their analyses, opinions, and conclusions to property owners and municipal officials in a manner that is meaningful and not misleading."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does DOR provide an example or template of the AAR?",
      "A": "Yes. We provide an AAR template on our \u301010\u2020website\u3011."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the difference between the Municipal Assessment Report (MAR) and the AAR?",
      "A": "The MAR reports an assessor's assessment figures. The AAR reports an assessor's assessment practices."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When should an assessor submit the AAR and who should it be delivered to?",
      "A": "Assessors and municipal officials must determine whether an AAR, or similar document, will assist with completion and communication of the assessment process, and may consider it a contractual item. If an AAR is completed, an assessor delivers the original signed AAR to the municipality before the Board of Review (BOR) begins."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does the AAR handle confidential information?",
      "A": "The AAR does not change confidentiality requirements. The assessor must keep confidential information\u2014such as income and expense data\u2014in a secure work file."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How can an assessor use the AAR for defense of value at Board of Review (BOR)?",
      "A": "An assessor can present the AAR or similar document for each BOR case (along with the summary of the individual property). Since each case stands on its own, if appealed, the AAR or similar document may be part of the record."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is the BOR required to provide written notice of determination to the objector?",
      "A": "Yes. The BOR must provide written notice of determination by personal delivery or by certified mail (return receipt requested). The state-prescribed Notice of Board of Review Determination (\u301010\u2020PR-302\u3011) includes the BOR's final assessment amount and the required explanation of appeal rights."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How should the BOR record the roll call votes?",
      "A": "The roll call votes must be recorded in the clerk's minute book and either by a stenographer or a recording device."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is considered \"filing of the objection form\" with the BOR clerk?",
      "A": "First, a property owner must provide the BOR clerk with a written or oral notice of intent to file an objection at least 48 hours before the first scheduled BOR meeting. The property owner must then fill out a written Objection Form for Real Property Assessment (\u301010\u2020PA-115A\u3011). This written objection is considered filed if the BOR clerk's office receives it within the first two hours of the first BOR meeting. The law does not state whether filing by fax or email constitutes a written objection. Municipalities should adopt a consistent position concerning electronic filing.\n\nIf the property owner did not provide a 48-hour notice of intent to object, the property owner must submit the written objection form and request a waiver (of the notice of intent requirement) during the first two hours of the BOR's first meeting."
    },
    {
      "Q": "As a property owner, is there a specific form I should complete to provide my notice of intent to file an objection?",
      "A": "No. You must give the BOR clerk either a written or oral notice of intent. There is no specific form for your notice. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) encourages you to submit a written notice. DOR also recommends the clerk's office maintain a log of telephone calls received as notices of intention to file objections. When a municipality receives a verbal notice of intent, they can request you complete the official Objection Form for Real Property Assessment (\u301010\u2020PA-115A\u3011) 48 hours before the first meeting, which would also serve as notice of intent."
    },

      "Q": "Can I appeal directly to the circuit court without going to the BOR?",
      "A": "\u2022 The BOR has the authority to waive a BOR hearing (at the request of the property owner, assessor or at its own discretion) and allow the property owner to appeal directly to the circuit court. To request a waiver, the property owner must:\n  - Submit a Request for Waiver of Board of Review Hearing (\u301010\u2020PA-813\u3011) to the BOR clerk\n  - Provide the BOR clerk with 48-hour notice of intent to appeal before the first BOR meeting\n  - Complete the Objection Form for Real Property Assessment (\u301010\u2020PA-115A\u3011)\n\n\u2022 At the first BOR meeting:\n  - BOR reviews hearing waiver requests\n  - BOR may grant the waiver and issue a decision, sustaining the assessment established by the assessor\n  - BOR may deny the waiver and require the property owner to appear before the BOR\n\n\u2022 Circuit court:\n  - An action under sec. \u301011\u202070.47(13)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis.

The BOR should not issue a \"Notice of Board of Review Decision.\"\n\n*State law allows the BOR to deny a hearing to a property owner who does not allow the assessor to complete an exterior view. However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court expressed due process concerns regarding a similarly worded statute in *Milewski v. Town of Dover*, 2017 WI 79. DOR recommends allowing a BOR hearing even if the property owner denied an interior or exterior view. The lack of access and the credibility of evidence can be handled as evidentiary issues at the hearing, rather than denying access to the BOR.*"

      "Q": "What should the BOR do if the property owner fails to A on the objection form, \"What is the taxable value of the property as of January 1?\"",
      "A": "Before swearing in the property owner, the BOR clerk should ask the property owner to submit a properly completed form. If the owner refuses to complete the entire form, the BOR should conduct a pre-hearing and determine it will not hear the case. Under state law (sec. \u301012\u202070.47(7)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), a property owner must submit a written objection, complete any required forms, and provide stated valuations of the property in Q. The BOR should not issue a determination notice. When the value being appealed is based on a market value class, case law is well-established on the necessity of the appellant providing an opinion of value on the objection form. If the appeal is of a non-market value class, the clerk should ask for the approximate acres and an estimate of the correct assessed value of those acres."

Stats.).\n\u2022 Consider waiving complex appeals to circuit court as provided by state law (sec. 70.47(8m), Wis. Stats.) using the Request for Waiver of BOR Hearing (PA-813)."

      "Q": "If a municipality is conducting a revaluation, does it have to provide a 30-day notice for its initial BOR meeting which is held for adjourning to a future date?",
      "A": "Yes. The 30-day notice applies to the initial BOR notice when the municipality is conducting a revaluation. If the assessment roll is not complete at the time of the BOR, the clerk may use a shortened BOR notice."

    {
      "Q": "Can a property owner request removal of more than one BOR member?",
      "A": "Yes. However, only one member can be removed without identifying a reason if there is a timely request (sec. \u301010\u202070.47(6m)(a)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.).

      "Q": "What is the impact on the BOR's authority if a trained member is removed from a specific case?",
      "A": "There is no impact as long as a quorum (a majority of BOR members) decides the case. The requirement is that the BOR as a body includes a trained member, but it is not necessary to have a trained member hear a specific objection if the trained member is removed. The trained member may remain in the room and is allowed to offer procedural advice to the BOR."

      "Q": "If the assessor changed an assessment at Open Book in the morning, gave the property owner a 15-day notice (30-day for a revaluation), and the municipality began the BOR that afternoon, how long should the BOR be kept open?",
      "A": "State law requires seven days between the end of Open Book (sec. \u301010\u202070.45\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.) and the start of the BOR (sec. \u30109\u202070.47\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.). After the initial meeting, unless the property owner is given the appropriate waiver (and signs it), the BOR needs to adjourn and reconvene 15 or more days later (30 days for a revaluation) to give the property owner an opportunity to appeal the assessment that was revised at Open Book. By doing so, the assessor meets the notice requirements under state law (sec. \u301011\u202070.365\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.). If the assessor changes the assessment at the Open Book, the assessor does not need to provide additional notice when the property owner waives the right (by submitting a form prescribed or approved by DOR) to the notice of the changed assessment in writing. Under this scenario, the assessor is not required to give an additional 15- or 30-day notice; and the BOR does not have to be kept open longer than otherwise needed."

      "Q": "Does the property owner always need to provide an estimate of the length of time it will take them to present at the hearing?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law (sec. \u301012\u202070.47(7)(ad)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), a property owner must provide this information \u2013 \"...and the person's reasonable estimate of the length of time that the hearing will take.\""

      "Q": "If the property owner is not present when the BOR schedules their hearing, how should the BOR notify the owner of the hearing?",
      "A": "State law does not specify the type of notice, but does require the BOR to provide it at least 48 hours before hearing the objection. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) recommends the BOR provide notice by first class mail, with an affidavit of mailing. DOR also recommends mailing the notice at least five days before the hearing, which allows for the mandatory 48-hour notice plus another three days for mail delivery."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the law allow an assessor to hold an Open Book for more than one district at a time?",
      "A": "No. This is not allowed. Holding multiple district Open Books at the same time would require a municipality to remove its assessment records and would require property owners to travel to another municipality for their Open Book. (Note: State law requires seven days between the end of Open Book and the start of the BOR.)"

      "Q": "Does the BOR provide written notice of determination to the property owner appealing the assessment?",
      "A": "Yes. Written notice of determination is mandatory and must be served by personal delivery or by certified mail (return receipt requested). The state-prescribed Notice of Board of Review (\u301013\u2020PR-302\u3011) includes the amount of the assessment as finalized by the BOR and the required explanation of appeal rights."

    {
      "Q": "Since a clerk must physically mail the determination notices, does the BOR need to adjourn to another day if the post office is closed when the BOR concludes its business?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law, the notices must be delivered or mailed before the BOR's final adjournment. While it is cumbersome to adjourn the BOR and reconvene after the notices are mailed, it is the required procedure."

      "Q": "What is the First Dollar Credit?",
      "A": "The First Dollar Credit provides direct property tax relief as a credit for Wisconsin property owners on their property tax bill."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Which parcels qualify for the First Dollar Credit?",
      "A": "Every taxable parcel (business, commercial or private) containing a real property improvement (e.g., building) qualifies for the First Dollar Credit. Unlike the Lottery and Gaming Credit, the property does not have to be the owner's primary residence. (Note: A personal property improvement does not qualify a parcel for this credit.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a property owner have to apply for this credit?",
      "A": "No. This credit is automatically applied to all qualifying properties. If the property tax bill shows an amount under \u201cAss'd Value Improvements,\u201d that property should receive the credit. If you feel the property qualifies for the credit and it does not appear on the tax bill, contact your local treasurer or clerk."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can an owner receive credit on more than one property?",
      "A": "Yes. Each taxable property (containing a real property improvement) qualifies for the credit. Unlike the Lottery and Gaming Credit, it does not have to be the owner's primary residence and you may claim more than one credit."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a Manufactured/Mobile Home qualify for the First Dollar Credit?",
      "A": "It depends. If the manufactured/mobile home is properly classified as real property, the home qualifies for the First Dollar Credit. However, if a manufactured home is classified as personal property, the home does not qualify for the First Dollar Credit. State law (sec. 70.043, Wis. Stats.) lists the criteria for determining if a manufactured/mobile home is real or personal property.\n\nA manufactured/mobile home is:\n- Real property \u2014 if the home is connected to utilities and is set upon a foundation upon land owned by the manufactured/mobile home owner (\"Set upon a foundation\" means it is off its wheels and set upon some other support)\n- Personal property \u2014 if the land on which it is located is not owned by the manufactured/mobile home owner or if the manufactured/mobile home is not set upon a foundation or connected to utilities"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If I am required to pay a manufactured/mobile home parking fee on my home, does my home qualify for the First Dollar Credit?",

    },
    {
      "Q": "Is the First Dollar Credit distributed to the county instead of the municipality, similar to the School Levy Tax and Lottery and Gaming Credits?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law (sec. \u301010\u202079.10 (7m)(c)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), the county distributes the amount received to each municipality and taxing jurisdiction in the county unless a municipality qualifies for one of the exceptions listed in this law and the municipality requests direct payment. A municipality should send its request for direct payment to the Wisconsin Department of Administration (DOA) by the end of February each year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where is the First Dollar Credit listed on the property tax bill?",
      "A": "It is located directly above the Lottery and Gaming Credit line on the property tax bill. (To review a sample of a state-prescribed property tax bill, see DOR publication: **(link to sample bill)**.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the First Dollar Credit apply only to classes 1, 2, 3 and 7, as long as there is an improvement on the parcel?",
      "A": "Although the parcel must contain an improvement to fit within one of these classes, it is better to determine if a parcel qualifies for the First Dollar Credit by looking at the parcel's improvement value field. If the parcel's improvement value is greater than zero, the parcel qualifies for the credit. (Note: The improvement must be correctly classified as real property to qualify; it cannot be classified as personal property.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When the First Dollar Credit is entered on the Taxation District Treasurer's Settlement Sheet, how does it impact the distribution of funds to the taxation districts?",
      "A": "DOA distributes First Dollar Credit payments on the 4th Monday of July. The county treasurer should distribute these amounts no later than August 20."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How are adjustments or corrections to the First Dollar Credit handled?",
      "A": "\u2022 Any error in the amount of funds distributed to a county/municipality by DOA (overpayment or underpayment) discovered by October 1 of the distribution year is corrected by reducing or increasing (as appropriate) the following year's distribution for that municipality.\n\u2022 Corrections are made in the distributions to all municipalities affected by the error under state law (sec. 79.10(6m), Wis. Stats.)."

      "Q": "Will DOR supply the Maximum Credit Value (MCV) similar to the Lottery and Gaming Credit value? If so, when can we expect to receive the value?",
      "A": "Yes. DOR provides the First Dollar Credit MCV by mid to late November, in the same manner we currently provide the Lottery and Gaming Credit MCV."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Will both the Lottery and Gaming Credit and the First Dollar Credit use the same equalized value school tax rate?",
      "A": "Yes. Both credits use the same equalized value school tax rate."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the First Dollar Credit applied to taxes due on a property tax bill?",
      "A": "Unlike the Lottery and Gaming Credit, the First Dollar Credit is applied equally to each installment.\n\nCalculating a single payment (payment in full) amount:\n- To determine the total amount due, subtract the Lottery and Gaming Credit, and the First Dollar Credit from the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit) and then add any special assessments, special charges and special taxes (PFC, MFL, Occupational).\n- Under an installment plan, when calculating the tax amount due for each installment, apply the First Dollar Credit equally across all the installments.\n\nExample: If there is a $31.95 First Dollar Credit, $15.98 credit is applied to the first payment and $15.97 to the second payment under a two-payment plan.\n\nTwo calculation methods:\n- **First method:**\n  * Subtract the First Dollar Credit from the net tax (net of\u00a0School Levy Tax Credit), and then divide the amount by the number of installments offered (two in the example above) to determine the amount due for the second and subsequent installments.\n  * For the first installment amount, subtract the Lottery and Gaming Credit from the same amount calculated for the second installment and then add any special assessments, special charges and special taxes.\n  * Note: Depending on the amounts of any special assessments, special charges and special taxes and whether a Lottery and Gaming Credit is available for this parcel, the amount due for the first installment may be greater than or less than the second and subsequent installment amounts.\n- **Second method:**\n  * Using two separate calculations, divide both the First Dollar Credit and the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit) by the number of installments. Take the results of dividing the net tax by the number of installments, add any special charges, subtract the Lottery and Gaming Credit, and subtract the First Dollar amount determined by dividing the allowable First Dollar Credit by the number of installments.\n  * The second and subsequent installments would be the amount of the net tax divided by the number of installments less the allowable First Dollar Credit divided by the number of installments. Extra cents can be applied to either the first or last installment.\n- **No matter which method is used**, an installment can never be less than zero. Since the entire Lottery and Gaming Credit is applied to the first installment (to the extent of the total tax due on the first installment), the Lottery and Gaming Credit (if applicable) should always be applied to the taxes due before the First Dollar Credit. For this reason, you may decide that the second method is the best method for calculating the amount due for each installment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the First Dollar Credit Calculated?",
      "A": "The credit calculation is very similar to the calculation for the Lottery and Gaming Credit. The First Dollar Credit is determined in November of each year. Based on available funds and an estimated number of properties that will qualify for the credit, a maximum credit value (MCV) is determined. The credit is calculated by multiplying the MCV (or the actual value of the property if that value is less than the MCV), by the applicable school tax rate. This is the amount of credit provided for that property. (sec. 79.10(5m), Wis. Stats.) For more information, review \"\u301012\u2020How to Calculate the First Dollar Credit\u3011.\""

      "Q": "What is the lottery and gaming credit?",
      "A": "The lottery and gaming credit is a credit that provides direct property tax relief to qualifying taxpayers on their property tax bills. Lottery proceeds are paid into a separate segregated state fund. The lottery credit is displayed on tax bills as a reduction of property taxes due."

      "A": "To qualify for the lottery and gaming credit, you must be a Wisconsin resident, own a dwelling and use it as your primary residence as of the January 1 certification date of the year the property taxes are levied.\n\nIf an owner is temporarily absent (typically no longer than six months, e.g., hospital stay, vacation, incarceration), the primary residence is the home where the owner returns. Principal dwelling means any dwelling the owner uses as his/her primary residence. A property owner may claim only one primary residence. You cannot claim the lottery and gaming credit on business property, rental units, vacant land, garages or other property that is not the owner's primary residence (sec. 79.10(1)(dm), (9)(bm), Wis. Stats.)."

    {
      "Q": "Do I have to apply for the lottery and gaming credit?",
      "A": "Yes. To receive the credit, an eligible property owner must file an application with the county treasurer where the property is located or with the city treasurer if the property is in a city that collects taxes under state law (sec. 74.87, Wis. Stats.). If you are eligible as of the January 1 certification date but your property tax bill does not show the credit, you may:\n- Claim the credit by applying to the municipal (town, village or city) treasurer where the property is located by January 31 after you receive your tax bill.\n- File a late claim application (if you missed the January 31 deadline) with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue by October 1 after your property tax bill is issued.\n\nLottery and gaming credit application forms are available on DOR's website. You can also file an application online using DOR's lottery credit online application portal."

      "Q": "How is the lottery and gaming credit calculated?",
      "A": "The amount of funds available for the lottery and gaming credit is determined in November of each year based on revenues generated from the Wisconsin Lottery, pari-mutuel on-track betting and bingo during the year.\n\nBased on available funds and an estimated number of properties qualifying for the credit, DOR determines a maximum credit value (MCV). The credit amount for each qualifying property is then calculated by multiplying the MCV (or the actual value of the property if that value is less than the MCV) by the applicable school tax rate. This is the amount of credit provided for that property. (sec. 79.10(9)(bm), (11), Wis. Stats.)"

      "Q": "Does a manufactured/mobile home that pays a monthly permit fee qualify?",
      "A": "Yes. It qualifies if the owner uses the manufactured/mobile home as their primary residence as of January 1 of the year the permit fees are applied. The municipal clerk calculates and deducts one-twelfth of the credit each month from the monthly municipal permit fee. Eligible manufactured/mobile home owners must file a lottery and gaming credit application with the municipal treasurer or the first class city treasurer (City of Milwaukee) to receive the credit.

      "A": "If you are eligible for the credit as of the January 1 certification date, but your property tax bill does not list the credit, you must file a late claim application with DOR by October 1 after your tax bill is issued. Under state law, a taxpayer may only claim the previous year's missing lottery and gaming credit (sec. 79.10(10)(bm), Wis. Stats.).

      "Q": "What if I purchased my home after January 1?",
      "A": "*(Typically, lottery credit eligibility is determined by ownership and primary residence status on January 1. If you purchase after that date, the credit for that year would have been claimed by the prior owner if eligible. You would qualify the next year if it's your primary residence.)*"

      "Q": "What happens if a property qualifying for the lottery and gaming credit is sold after January 1?",

      "A": "Formula for calculating the school levy tax credit:\n\nMunicipality's 3-Year Average School Levies / Statewide 3-Year Average School Levies x Total Funding = Municipality's Credit\n\n*Example:* If a municipality\u2019s 3-year average school levies are 7,960,546 and the statewide 3-year average is 5,559,570,121, and total funding is $1,275,000,000, then:\n\nMunicipality\u2019s credit = (7,960,546 / 5,559,570,121) x 1,275,000,000 = $1,825,626 (approx.)\n\n*Note:* The total funding changed effective for 2025 from $1,195,000,000 to $1,275,000,000."

    {
      "Q": "Is the school levy tax credit paid to the school district?",
      "A": "No. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) distributes this credit to counties and municipalities. DOR makes the payments to the county where the municipality is located and then the county distributes the payment to the municipality. (Note: DOR can make payments directly to a municipality if it qualifies for an exception and follows the requirements under state law, sec. 79.10(7m)(cm), Wis. Stats.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When are towns, villages and cities notified of the school levy tax credit amount?",
      "A": "DOR must inform municipalities of their school levy tax credit payments on or before November 20 each year. (sec. 79.10(2), Wis. Stats.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the school levy tax credit reported on individual property tax bills?",
      "A": "On property tax bills, school tax levies are reported after subtracting the school levy tax credits. The amount of the school levy tax credit for the current year is listed in a separate box on each property tax bill.\n\nThe credit is calculated for each individual tax bill as:\n\n(Total municipality's school levy tax credit / Final Statement of Assessment for municipality) x the property's assessed value on the tax bill = School Levy Tax Credit for that property.\n\n*Example:* If a municipality has $81,293.86 in total school levy credit and a Final SOA total value of $78,419,700, and a given property is assessed at $332,100, then that property\u2019s credit = (81,293.86 / 78,419,700) x 332,100 = ~$344.27.\n\n*Note:* The final SOA must equal the total value of all school districts (K-12 plus K-8) within the municipality."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does a property owner qualify for the school levy tax credit?",
      "A": "The school levy tax credit is applied to every taxable property. The credit amount is based on the property's assessed value as a percent of the municipality's total assessed value. There is no special application; every property automatically receives it based on value."

      "Q": "Zoning requires a minimum of five acres to split off as a residential parcel. Can I use that acreage requirement as the land \"necessary for the location and convenience\" of the agricultural improvements, when the agricultural buildings include a residence?",
      "A": "No. Even though the minimum residential parcel size may be five acres, if all or part of the land is primarily devoted to a qualifying agricultural use under administrative rule (sec. Tax \u301010\u202018\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Adm. Code), the qualifying acreage is classified as agricultural. Actual acreage devoted to the farm site (collection of agricultural buildings, including the residence) should be determined independently for each parcel. Acreage use, not zoning, is the determining factor."

    {
      "Q": "A 40-acre parcel classified as agricultural (class 4) in 2024 is sold during that year. The property was re-zoned residential, and a subdivision approval was granted before January 1, 2025. As of June 2025, the parcel was covered with last year's crop stubble. Do the earlier activities indicating a future use change and the lack of use in agricultural meet the rule's criteria of \"incompatible with agricultural use?\"",
      "A": "This parcel does not become incompatible with agricultural use based solely on the legal changes (rezoning and subdivision approval). Even the presence of survey stakes may not stop a farmer from producing and harvesting an agricultural crop. Since the land was in an agricultural use during the production season before the January 1, 2025 assessment date, its classification on the January 1, 2025 assessment roll remains agricultural."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality pass an ordinance against using land for agricultural purposes, which in effect would disallow agricultural classification of that land?",
      "A": "A municipality may pass such an ordinance. The legality of the ordinance and its enforcement is case-specific. Land must be classified as agricultural if it was devoted primarily to a qualifying agricultural use under administrative rule (sec. Tax \u301010\u202018\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Adm. Code) during the prior production season and was compatible with agricultural use on January 1 of the current assessment year. Even if in violation of an ordinance, easement, or contract, the agricultural classification applies until the land is no longer devoted primarily to a qualifying agricultural use."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Should land actively used for agricultural purposes, in violation of a local ordinance prohibiting agricultural use, still be classified as agricultural?",
      "A": "Yes. Since state law supersedes local ordinances, this land is classified as agricultural because it meets the definition of agricultural use under sec. Tax \u301010\u202018\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Adm. Code. Enforcement of the ordinance is a municipal issue. Once the land is no longer used for agricultural purposes (either through enforcement or landowner choice), the classification must be changed. (Land must be classified as agricultural if it was devoted primarily to a qualifying agricultural use in the prior production season and was compatible with agricultural use on January 1. Even if in violation for the current year, the classification stays agricultural until the use changes.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) considered an agricultural use?",
      "A": "Yes. Administrative rule (sec. Tax \u301010\u202018\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Adm. Code) lists enrollment in CRP as an agricultural use. However, land removed from the CRP program may now be incompatible with agricultural use (e.g., if it has succeeded to woodland) and may need to be reclassified and valued appropriately. For more information on programs qualifying for agricultural classification, see the \u301011\u2020Tax 18 Publication\u3011."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can land enrolled in other programs be considered an agricultural use?",
      "A": "Lands in other programs may qualify; see the \u301011\u2020Tax 18 Publication\u3011. Note: If land is devoted primarily to an agricultural use under sec. Tax \u301012\u202018.05(1)(a)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, \u301012\u2020(b)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, or \u301012\u2020(c)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011 during the prior production season and is not in a use incompatible with agriculture on the assessment date, it may qualify for agricultural classification. In essence, the land may qualify for use-value assessment based on how it was used, not merely what program it\u2019s in."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When is forest land properly classified as pasture land?",
      "A": "Pastured woods devoted primarily to agricultural use (keeping, grazing, or feeding livestock) qualify for agricultural classification. Active grazing keeps the undergrowth down. A few paths through the woods are not enough evidence of active pasture. The land must be pastured regularly. There should be fencing preventing animals from straying. Land with little to no vegetation isn't considered pasture. (Definitions: see the Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual \u2013 pasture vs. forest \u2013 and the \u301013\u2020Agricultural Assessment Guide for Wisconsin Property Owners\u3011.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are small parcels of land eligible for agricultural classification?",
      "A": "Yes. Size is not a factor by itself. Even a small acreage (e.g., a 5-acre apple orchard or a small vegetable plot) can be primarily devoted to agricultural use and thus be classified agricultural. What matters is that the land was primarily used for an agricultural purpose (as defined in sec. \u301015\u2020Tax 18.05(1)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011) during the year prior to the assessment and not put to an incompatible use by January 1. Assessors should not use arbitrary size thresholds; they must consider the actual use of each parcel individually."

      "A": "*(Summarized from example)*\n- **Parcel A:** 5 acres (2 acres crops harvested last fall, remainder wooded). Classify 2 acres agricultural, rest residential (wooded area considered part of likely residential lot).\n- **Parcel B:** 5 acres (2-acre field extension of A's field, 3 acres fallow tillable). Classify part agricultural (the 2-acre field) and part residential (the fallow land, since it's in a subdivision with infrastructure, sale as residential imminent, typical residential size).\n- **Parcel C:** 4 acres (house, 3 acres trees, 1 acre ag field part of farm operation). Classify 1 acre agricultural, balance residential (house site and woods supporting residential use).\n- **Parcel D:** 5 acres (mostly woods, 1 acre fallow, house). Classify entirely residential (no active ag; fallow portion is part of subdivision with imminent home construction).\n- **Parcel E:** 5 acres (2 acres fallow field, 3 acres woods). Classify entirely residential (no qualifying ag use, in subdivision context similar to D).\n- **Parcel F:** 5 acres (all farmed last year, no buildings). Classify agricultural (in active crop use, qualifies for use-value assessment).\n- **Parcel G:** 5 acres (adjacent to F, all woods). Classify residential (in subdivision, no ag, infrastructure in place, etc.).\n- **Parcel H:** 5 acres (all woods, next to G, adjacent to I which is fallow). Classify residential (similar reasoning as G).\n- **Parcel I:** 5 acres (fallow, adjacent to H). Classify residential (no current ag, part of subdivision)."

      "Q": "How are site acres of other (class 7) determined? How does a property owner appeal the assessor's determination of the size of the farm site?",
      "A": "Per state law, the land necessary for the location and convenience of the farm home and farm buildings is classified as other (class 7). To determine the site acreage, the assessor should use aerial photos and scale out the area actually used for the buildings. If a property owner disagrees with the determined site acres, they should bring credible evidence (e.g., a certified survey map, updated aerial photo, other documentation) to the assessor and, if needed, to Open Book or Board of Review."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the classification of other (class 7) improvements determined? What factors are used to make this determination? Is it proper to classify a set of improvements by listing the agricultural outbuildings as other (class 7) and the residence as residential (class 1)?",
      "A": "Generally, improvements should be classified as other (class 7) when the predominant use of the building set is agricultural. Factors include current use, potential use, number and significance of outbuildings, parcel size, and the nature of the agricultural buildings supporting the farm. Assessors should classify a set of buildings with a single class based on the predominant use of the entire set, rather than splitting the class of buildings. However, state law (sec. \u301016\u202070.32(2)(c)1m\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011) allows an assessor to classify a typical farm residential building set as \"other\" if the residence is used by the farm operator's spouse, children, parents, or grandparents, and the residence is on land that is part of the farm operation."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How should the site acres for other (class 7) lands be valued? Should they be valued as one- or two-acre parcels? Should the fact that the site is part of a larger parcel be considered?",
      "A": "Land necessary for the location and convenience of buildings should be valued at its contributory market value, adjusted to the overall assessment level of the municipality. Each improved agricultural site must be analyzed for how many acres are needed for the buildings. Some sites with extensive buildings may need more acres; others less. Assessors should not assume the same site size for all farms in the town. When valuing the site, consider its contribution to the total parcel's value, not as if it's always a fixed 1 or 2 acres independent of the farm."

      "Q": "How should an assessor classify tillable land where the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources purchased an easement that does not allow tilling or grazing the land?",
      "A": "If the land is enrolled in a qualifying government program under administrative rule (sec. Tax \u301015\u202018.05(1)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011), it should be classified as agricultural and placed in the sub-class it would be if farmed (e.g., tillable). If it does not qualify (no ag use due to easement), its class must change to something else \u2013 likely undeveloped (5), agricultural forest (5m), or productive forest (6) \u2013 and then valued at market value (considering any easement effect on value). Then those values are adjusted to 50% for classes 5 and 5m (undeveloped/ag forest) and all classes adjusted to the community\u2019s average assessment level. (Land must remain classified agricultural if it was devoted primarily to ag use in the prior year and was compatible on Jan 1, even if an easement is in place, until it is no longer devoted to ag use.)"

      "Q": "How is a 20-acre parcel with a one-acre building site and 19 acres of grazing area for a horse classified? Are the 19 acres considered an agricultural use?",
      "A": "- Keeping a horse for personal use or boarding horses does NOT meet the definition of agricultural use under sec. Tax \u301015\u202018.05\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Adm. Code. Some activities might look agricultural but don't fit the defined categories (by rule, things like training race horses, riding stables, rental of saddle horses, operating a racetrack are considered recreation, not agriculture).\n- Raising horses under NAICS 112920 (i.e., operations that provide foal rearing, health maintenance, controlled feeding and harvest for eventual sale) is considered an agricultural use.\n- Renting land to a horse owner may appear to be pasture, but if the land isn't being used for an agricultural purpose as defined above, it is not eligible for agricultural classification.\n\n*(So in the example, if the horse grazing is just personal or boarding and not part of an agricultural enterprise like horse breeding for sale, the land would not be agricultural. Likely the 19 acres would be classified as residential or other, not agricultural.)*"

      "Q": "A person bought a parcel of agricultural and forest land during 2024 for substantially more than the 2024 assessment. The municipality was revalued in 2025. For 2025, the assessor assessed the agricultural land using the published 2025 use values. The remaining forest land was assessed using the 2024 selling price minus the 2025 use value of the agricultural lands. Was this correct?",
      "A": "No. The sale should be analyzed by determining the contributory market value of each component (ag land vs. other land). After finding the market value portion for each component, the non-agricultural land should be assessed per normal market valuation rules. The tillable and pasture land were correctly assessed at use-value for 2025. However, the assessor should not simply subtract the use-value from the sale price to derive the other land's value. The forest (non-ag) land must be assessed at market value in line with statutory provisions, independent of the use-value calculation for the ag part."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is there a conversion charge for converting agricultural land to another use?",
      "A": "- Yes. Property no longer used for agricultural purposes that benefited from lower taxes due to ag classification is subject to a conversion charge if the use changes to residential, commercial or manufacturing.\n- However, if ag land is converted to another use and becomes exempt, the assessor must consider what its classification would be if it were not exempt to decide if a conversion fee applies. No conversion charge if the land meets the definition of and is classified as undeveloped, agricultural forest, productive forest, or \"other\" (e.g., farm home site).\n- The assessor makes the determination on the following year's roll. The conversion charge per acre decreases as the acreage converted increases (more acres = lower $ per acre).

      "Q": "Can Board of Review (BOR) members view the property in person to determine whether a piece of property is used for pasture, rather than woods?",
      "A": "No. The BOR may only act on sworn evidence presented to it. The BOR can change a classification (and value) if sworn testimony or evidence at the hearing supports that action. Under state law (sec. \u301018\u202070.47\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011, Wis. Stats.), the BOR can only act on evidence under oath. (They cannot independently go inspect the property as part of the hearing deliberation process.)"

    {
      "Q": "Is maple sap gathering considered an agricultural activity, and if so, how should this type of land be assessed?",
      "A": "Yes. By administrative rule, maple sap gathering is a qualifying agricultural use (NAICS includes it as crop production). Land devoted primarily to tapping maple trees for sap during the season before the assessment and not put to a conflicting use by January 1 is classified as agricultural and assessed at its use value. There is no minimum acreage; even small tracts can qualify if primarily used for maple sap. The key is that the area of woods is sufficiently tapped per industry standards (roughly at least 20 tapped maples per acre in mixed woods, 30-40 per acre in high-quality maple stands). A forest area with no or very minimal tapping does not qualify. Occasional or minimal tapping over a large area and claiming the whole as ag does not qualify; the activity must be bona fide and significant in that area."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are licensed game farms considered an agricultural use?",
      "A": "The NAICS classifies game farms, fishing preserves, hunting preserves, and game propagation under Fishing, Hunting and Trapping industries \u2013 not agriculture. So land used for those is classified by its actual use (possibly commercial or forest) and valued at market. However, operations for deer farming (raising deer for eventual sale \u2013 i.e. NAICS livestock farming) can be agricultural. If fenced land is devoted primarily to deer production, it is agricultural land (categorized as grade 1, 2, 3 or pasture based on soil)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is aquaculture an agricultural use?",
      "A": "Land devoted primarily to animal aquaculture (fish farming) qualifies as agricultural use under sec. Tax \u301010\u202018.05(1)(b)\u2020docs.legis.wisconsin.gov\u3011 (Animal Production). These are operations that actively manage breeding, feeding, and health of fish. An outdoor fish pond used to raise fish for market is considered akin to pasture (as land supporting animal production) and can be classified as agricultural. However, not all aquaculture facilities qualify: concrete raceways, indoor hatcheries, etc., do not meet the definition of \"land...devoted primarily to agricultural use\" (they're structures/improvements). Also, recreational ponds or personal-use ponds do not qualify."

    {
      "Q": "Is cranberry production an agricultural use?",
      "A": "Yes. Land under cranberry beds is devoted primarily to an agricultural use. It should be classified as agricultural and typically categorized as third-grade tillable, then adjusted to the local assessment level. Note: Land under related earthen structures (dams, dikes, ditches, inlets, outlets around the beds) is classed as \"other\" (class 7) and assessed at the third-grade tillable value (again adjusted to local level). The earthen structures themselves are valued via cost less depreciation."

      "Q": "Is nursery stock production an agricultural use?",
      "A": "Yes. NAICS 111421 (nursery and floriculture production) covers growing nursery products, stock, shrubbery, bulbs, sod, etc., which is crop production and thus agriculture. Also, state law now specifically includes growing short rotation woody crops (harvest cycle 10 years or less for pulp/biomass) as agriculture. (Just occasionally harvesting a few trees on one's land, however, is not primarily an agricultural use.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How are agricultural use-values determined?",
      "A": "DOR annually publishes use-values for tillable grades 1, 2, 3 and pasture land. DOR uses a formula based on the income approach: income is derived from crop-share agreements (which net out certain farming costs) and corn yield data. Use-values are calculated for each municipality in each county. Annual changes in use-value are capped by the statewide change in equalized value, minus growth from new construction and minus the change in overall ag land value. See the Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual (WPAM) Chapter 14, Appendix B for details."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does an assessor know if acreage is enrolled in a program eligible for agricultural classification if the land is not currently being used for agriculture?",
      "A": "The assessor should directly inquire. They can call, email, or send an \"Agricultural Classification Conservation Program Information Request\" (Form PR-324) to owners of parcels that appear Qable (no obvious ag use visible). This form or outreach helps determine if the owner has the land in a qualifying conservation program that would allow agricultural classification even if the land isn't actively farmed that year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How should the phrase \"production season\" as specified in administrative rule (sec. Tax 18.06(1), Wis. Adm. Code) be applied in determining eligibility for agricultural use valuation?",
      "A": "\"Production season\" generally means the period from spring through fall when typical farming activities occur. This phrase provides a standard for assessors to judge if land was \"primarily devoted\" to ag use. Most agricultural uses in Wisconsin occur during this growing season. If there is an agricultural use that occurs outside the typical season (e.g., winter-only use), those cases are rare and should be discussed between the owner and assessor. Usually, land needs to be in ag use during the normal growing season. If land is only used very briefly outside the normal season, the assessor must look carefully at whether that constitutes its primary use. In general, if land is only used for ag for a minimal time outside spring-fall, and not at all during spring-fall, it likely wouldn't qualify as primarily devoted to agriculture."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the conversion charge calculated?",
      "A": "The number of acres converted is multiplied by a per-acre value for each converted acre. That per-acre value is calculated in two steps:\n1. First, find the difference between the county\u2019s average fair market value of agricultural land (based on prior year sales of 38+ acre ag land) and the county\u2019s average equalized value per acre of agricultural land (its use-value).\n2. Then apply a conversion size factor:\n   - If >30 acres are converted, multiply the difference by 5% to get the charge per acre.\n   - If 10 to 30 acres, multiply difference by 7.5%.\n   - If <10 acres, multiply difference by 10%.\n\n*Example 1:* County avg market value/acre for ag land = $5,490; county avg use-value/acre = $210; difference = $5,280.\nConversion charge per acre = $264 if >30 acres (5% of 5,280), $396 if 10-30 acres (7.5%), $528 if <10 acres (10%).\n\n*Example 2:* If 1.33 acres are converted (<10), charge = $528 * 1.33 = $702. (When totaling acres, combine all acres owned by the same entity in the same municipality converting that year.)\n\nSee DOR's **Agricultural Land Conversion Charge Guidelines** for per-acre charges by acreage band. (No charge if the computed per-acre charge would be < $25.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a parcel is split, how is the size calculated when determining which conversion charge to apply?",
      "A": "The conversion charge is based on change of use, not merely reclassification. If ag land is subdivided into lots and reclassified as residential (but still actively farmed at the moment), strictly splitting doesn't trigger the charge until the use actually changes. The total acres that change use in a year (under the same ownership in a municipality) determine the acreage bracket for the charge percentage."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who issues the conversion charge?",
      "A": "The county treasurer issues the conversion charge as a special charge on the property tax bill of the converted land, once notified by the assessor\u2019s report (on the assessment roll) of the change in use."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When are the values used in the conversion charge calculation available?",
      "A": "The average fair market value of ag land and average use-value (needed for the calc) are typically available annually after the prior year\u2019s sales are analyzed. DOR usually provides these figures in the summer or early fall to use for that year\u2019s charges."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there exceptions to a conversion charge?",
      "A": "Yes. No charge applies if the per-acre charge would compute to less than $25. Also, conversions to certain exempt or other agricultural classes (undeveloped, ag forest, productive forest, \u201cother\u201d) are not charged unless they later convert to a developed class."

      "Q": "If land converts to undeveloped land (class 5), agricultural forest (class 5m), productive forest (class 6) or other (class 7) for one year, and then converts to residential (class 1), is it then liable for a conversion charge?",
      "A": "If the land\u2019s use fundamentally changed from agriculture to a use that is still taxed (like undeveloped or forest) and then to residential, the conversion charge applies at the point it changes to a developed class (residential). However, if it stayed in another open-space class for one year then went residential, the assessor at the time of change to residential would issue the charge."

      "A": "The assessor should apply class 7 \"other\" to those qualifying family-occupied farm residences as allowed by law.

The assessor did not discover the changes until after the 2024 assessment was completed. The 2024 taxes reflected only the original \"other\" site and improvements from 2023. For the January 1, 2025 assessment, the parcel was reclassified as residential, with a significantly higher improvement value. Does a conversion charge apply?",
      "A": "Yes, likely. In 2025 the land use had clearly changed (farm land became part of an expanded home site and the improvement became residential use). Once the assessor reclassifies to residential, a conversion charge is due on the acres that were ag in 2023 and have now become part of the residential site. The fact it was missed in 2024 means it\u2019s caught up in 2025; the charge would be calculated on the acres converted to non-ag use (the three acres) using the values in effect. The delay doesn\u2019t avoid the charge."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What should an assessor do when discovering land was misclassified?",
      "A": "They should correct the classification on the next assessment roll and, if it resulted in a conversion (ag to developed use), report it so the conversion charge can be issued. If the misclassification resulted in omitted tax or overpaid tax, they might also need to handle it via correction of error procedures or inform the municipality for a chargeback if taxes were refunded."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is land previously classified as agricultural that is left fallow, subject to a conversion charge?",
      "A": "If land simply lies fallow but isn\u2019t put to a non-ag use and remains owned by the same person, it\u2019s usually still considered agricultural (fallow land is still agricultural if it's part of normal crop rotation or temporary). Just being fallow is not a conversion if the intent/use is still agricultural. A conversion fee would not apply unless it was actually changed to a developed use (residential/commercial etc.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the property was classified agricultural on January 1 and entered in the Managed Forest Law (MFL) program during that year (becoming exempt on the assessment roll), is a conversion charge due?",
      "A": "No, because MFL land is exempt. Also, conversion charges are not applied when ag land becomes exempt forest (the law specifically only charges for conversions to residential, commercial, manufacturing). However, the assessor would note its change for classification purposes."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What if I disagree with the property's change in classification?",
      "A": "You can appeal the assessor\u2019s classification. First, discuss with the assessor. If unresolved, you can object to the classification before the Board of Review. If still unsatisfied after BOR, further appeal to DOR under sec. 70.85 or to circuit court can be options depending on the situation."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When is the conversion charge due?",
      "A": "It\u2019s included as a special charge on the property\u2019s tax bill for the year of conversion. That tax bill is due with the usual property tax due dates (Jan 31 or installments). Essentially, when the land is converted and noted on the Jan 1 assessment, the charge gets billed in December of that year on the tax bill, due the following January."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a change in use takes place, and a conversion charge is due, but no conversion charge is issued, can a county treasurer issue the conversion charge in the following years?",
      "A": "If it was missed, the treasurer can still collect it later once discovered (similar to how omitted taxes can be picked up). However, ideally the charge is placed on the very next bill after conversion. If not, there might be procedures to issue it later, but it\u2019s complicated; better to catch it timely."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who owes the conversion charge?",
      "A": "The owner of the property at the time the tax bill with the charge is issued is responsible for paying it (just like property taxes). Essentially, it\u2019s attached to the land, so the current owner gets the bill."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How are buyers being made aware of the potential conversion charge?",
      "A": "Ideally through disclosure: the conversion charge is recorded as a special charge on tax bills if triggered. Also, Wisconsin law requires that offers to purchase agricultural land include a notice about the potential conversion charge. Title companies and realtors often alert buyers if land is subject to use-value recapture (conversion charge) risk."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What if the conversion charge is not paid?",
      "A": "It is treated like a delinquent property tax. Unpaid conversion charges will accrue interest/penalties and can eventually lead to tax delinquency proceedings (including tax certificate and foreclosure) if not paid."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the county subtract the administrative costs of collection from the conversion charge amount returned to the taxation districts?",
      "A": "No, the law doesn\u2019t provide for the county to skim administrative costs from the collected conversion charge. The collected charge is apportioned to the underlying taxing jurisdictions per statute without an administrative fee."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the county share the 1% per month added interest payment 50/50 with the municipality, or does the county keep that income?",
      "A": "Typically, for delinquent taxes, the interest/penalties might be apportioned by state law (often counties retain some portion for costs). For conversion charges, since treated as tax, the interest on delinquent special charges might be retained by the county similar to delinquent tax interest distribution rules. (This might be detailed in statutes \u2013 likely the county keeps the interest since they bear the collection responsibility.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Once a conversion charge becomes a special charge on the tax bill, can a county add its 0.5% tax to the bill, like with \"other\" special charges?",
      "A": "Usually, counties cannot add extra fees beyond what the statute authorizes. The 0.5% county sales tax does not apply to property tax bills. Perhaps this is referring to interest on specials \u2013 but if it\u2019s a special charge, the county can\u2019t tack on a sales tax. So no, the county\u2019s 0.5% sales tax has nothing to do with the property tax bill or special charges."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do the overlying taxation jurisdictions share in the conversion charge?",
      "A": "Yes. When a conversion charge is collected, it is ultimately returned proportionally to the other taxing jurisdictions (county, school, technical college, etc.) based on how the tax levy was shared, after first reimbursing the state for its portion (if any). Essentially it reverses the original distribution of tax on that land."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are exempt entities (e.g., churches and benevolent associations) subject to the conversion charge?",
      "A": "Yes, if they convert ag land to an exempt use, the conversion charge still applies because it\u2019s based on the change of use from agricultural. Even if the new owner is exempt from future property taxes, the charge for the prior benefit of use-value still applies."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are governmental entities subject to the conversion charge under state law (sec. 74.485, Wis. Stats.)?",
      "A": "Yes, there\u2019s no blanket exemption for government entities in the conversion charge statute. If a municipality or the state buys ag land and takes it to an exempt use, a conversion charge is due (though effectively one government paying another). There are some cases where if state condemns land, perhaps no charge, but generally yes, governments are not exempt."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a conversion charge be issued more than once on the same parcel of land?",
      "A": "Yes, if the land cycles back into agriculture and again out to a developed use, theoretically a new conversion charge could apply for the new conversion. However, the statute prevents double-charging for the same conversion. But if, for example, part of a parcel converted one year (charge issued), and the remaining part converts later, that later part can incur its own charge."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is a chargeback of rescinded or refunded taxes?",
      "A": "A municipality may request reimbursement (\"chargeback\") of property taxes it has refunded or rescinded to a property owner. If DOR approves the request, the other taxing jurisdictions must pay the municipality back for the amounts it had previously settled with them in the tax collection process. Requests must be e-filed using the Request for Chargeback of Rescinded or Refunded Taxes (Form PC-201). Before submitting to DOR:\n- The property owner must have requested and received a refund of overpaid taxes (with any interest) from the municipality.\n- The municipality must have actually refunded or rescinded those taxes to the owner."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I file a chargeback of rescinded or refunded taxes?",
      "A": "You must e-file Form PC-201 (Request for Chargeback of Rescinded or Refunded Taxes) via MyDORGov. (See DOR\u2019s Online Filing Help for using My DOR Government Account.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do I need a PIN number or password to file a chargeback request?",
      "A": "The request is filed in MyDORGov. You need to be an authorized user for the municipality\u2019s account to file. (Refer to Online Filing Help \u2013 Using My DOR Government Account for details on access.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are the requirements for submitting a request for chargeback of rescinded or refunded taxes to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR)?",
      "A": "For refunds of taxes on or after Jan 1, 2018: the refunded tax for any single property (parcel) for one year must be $250 or more. You can include taxes from any of the five assessment years immediately preceding the year you submit the PC-201 (or from a court decision) as long as you submit within one year of that court decision.\n\nFor older assessments (Jan 1, 2017 and prior): the threshold was $500 per parcel or an aggregate of $5,000 of refunded taxes from that year for the district.\n\nNote: The property owner must have actually received the refund (with interest, if applicable) before the chargeback request is sent to DOR."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What if a municipality doesn't file the request by the October 1 deadline?",
      "A": "If the municipality misses the October 1 deadline for a given year, it may submit the request (Form PC-201) by October 1 of the next year. DOR will then treat it as a request in that next cycle, and make a determination by November 15 of that following year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When and who does DOR notify after making a determination?",
      "A": "After DOR processes chargeback requests received by October 1, we certify the chargeback amounts by November 15. DOR sends the municipal clerk a copy of the request form with our determination, showing the amount each taxing jurisdiction must pay. We also notify each affected taxing jurisdiction. (Even if DOR denies a request, the determination copy will show $0 for that jurisdiction, for record.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When do the affected taxing jurisdictions have to pay their amount of the chargeback to the municipality that filed the chargeback request?",
      "A": "Each taxing jurisdiction must pay the municipality by February 15 of the year following DOR's November determination."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a Tax Incremental District have any effect on our chargeback determination made by DOR?",
      "A": "If the refunded/rescinded taxes were for property in a Tax Incremental District (TID), those taxes are not eligible for chargeback **unless** the TID\u2019s current value is below its base value in the year of the refund. In other words, normally TID taxes can\u2019t be charged back (because the city would eat it within the TID), except if the TID is distressed (value dropped below base)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the chargeback amount have an effect on mill rate limits?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 74.41(6), Wis. Stats.), if a taxing jurisdiction levies tax to cover a chargeback it owes, that amount is excluded when calculating any statutory mill rate limit. It doesn\u2019t count against their cap."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is a Preliminary Chargeback Determination memo, and why did I receive one?",
      "A": "DOR may send out a Preliminary Chargeback Determination memo to municipalities and taxing jurisdictions if a large chargeback request is being processed. This memo is basically a heads-up (preliminary approval) so that affected jurisdictions can budget for the amount they\u2019ll owe. DOR still issues the official certification by November 15, and jurisdictions still pay by Feb 15 following \u2013 the preliminary memo just helps with budgeting."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do we need to issue bills to each taxing jurisdiction?",
      "A": "No. By November 15, DOR will notify each taxing jurisdiction of what they owe to the municipal treasurer by Feb 15. The municipal treasurer doesn\u2019t have to send a bill; the jurisdictions are expected to pay based on DOR\u2019s certification."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do we know what statute relates to the rescinded or refunded tax?",
      "A": "The assessor\u2019s correction or the process that led to the refund should cite a statute. For example: sec. 70.511 (assessment objection settled in court), 74.33 (refund due to palpable error, etc.), 70.43 (corrected roll errors) etc. The assessor and clerk should identify under which statute the refund was made."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Should I file Form PC-200 or PC-201?",
      "A": "- File **Form PC-201** for chargeback of rescinded/refunded taxes under sec. 74.41, Wis. Stats. (that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been discussing). Due by Oct 1.\n- File **Form PC-200** for chargeback of uncollected personal property taxes under sec. 74.42, Wis. Stats. This is a separate process for when personal property taxes are delinquent and meet certain criteria (business closed, bankrupted, property removed). PC-200 is filed between Feb 2 and Apr 1 of the year following the tax became delinquent.\n\n*(Note: As of 2024, Act 12 exempted most personal property from taxes, so PC-200 will be phased out after 2025.)*"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there additional resources for the chargeback process?",
      "A": "Yes. See **Publication PA-600** (Property Tax Refund Requests and the Chargeback Process) for detailed guidance."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What do we report on the Statement of Assessment (SOA) Line 23?",
      "A": "Report only assessed value changes due to sec. 70.43 corrections of errors by assessors. If an assessed value was reduced, report it as a negative number. If increased, report as a positive number."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What do we report on the Statement of Taxes (SOT) Section I?",
      "A": "Report only the additional tax amounts or refunded tax amounts due to sec. 70.43 assessor error corrections. Additional taxes (if any) are a positive amount. Refunded or rescinded taxes are a negative amount."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do we know if our municipality has a chargeback?",
      "A": "Review state law sec. 74.41 or check if your clerk submitted any Form PC-201 by Oct 1. Additionally, DOR\u2019s determination letter by Nov 15 would inform you. Basically, unless you applied, you won\u2019t have one; if you did, DOR\u2019s response tells you."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do we calculate the refund after the BOR certifies the value of the assessor's correction?",
      "A": "If a Board of Review under sec. 70.43 certifies a value change due to assessor error, the refund to the taxpayer (and thus the chargeback amount) is the difference in taxes resulting from the value correction, plus interest if applicable (interest usually 0.8% per month from the date of payment, if refunded after Feb 1)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do we need to refund interest?",
      "A": "Yes, if a taxpayer is owed a refund of taxes (like due to a 70.43 correction or court order) and it\u2019s after a certain date (usually February 1), the law often requires interest be paid to the taxpayer. The interest is typically 0.8% per month from the date the tax was paid until the refund date. The interest paid is also included in what can be charged back to the other jurisdictions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "With the exemption of all locally assessed and manufacturing personal property effective January 1, 2024, can we still charge back personal property?",
      "A": "For taxes as of 2024 onward, there will be no locally assessed personal property taxes (Act 12). So going forward, Form PC-200 will be obsolete because new personal property delinquency situations won\u2019t occur. However, if there are still delinquent personal property taxes from 2022 or 2023 that meet criteria, you could still file PC-200 up through 2025."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When is the filing deadline for MFR?",
      "A": "Municipalities and counties with a population:\n- 2,500 or less – March 31\n- Over 2,500 – May 1\n- Extended due date for all municipalities and counties – May 15 (no request required)\nMunicipalities and counties with a population over 25,000:\n- July 31​ – must also submit an auditor's opinion (Administrative Rule Tax 16.05) with a final version of the Financial Report\n- To submit the auditor's opinion (Administrative Rule Tax 16), you must e-file an amended financial report and attach the auditor's opinion\n- Auditor's opinion must indicate whether the information submitted is a clear representation of the municipality's or county's audited financial statements"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How are municipalities and counties notified that the MFR form is available for filing?",
      "A": "In early February, DOR notifies each county and municipality by email that the Municipal Financial Report Forms are available in MyDORGov. The email includes the following information:\n- Filing instructions\n- State Payment Register – record of payments that Wisconsin state agencies made to Wisconsin municipalities and counties\n- U.S. Census Bureau Form F-65 – is available on our MFR web page"

    },
    {
      "Q": "Will I be charged a penalty if I file this report late?",
      "A": "Yes. If you do not file this report by May 15, state law (sec. 86.303(5)) requires a late filing penalty that reduces your General Transportation Aid payments from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT). This penalty is calculated and imposed by the DOT.\nIf DOR does not receive your report, we may request that a Certified Public Accountant compile the report from your municipal or county records. Your municipality or county is billed directly for this cost."

    },
    {
      "Q": "Why are some values on the MFR auto-filled; can I change these values?",
      "A": "Some auto-filled line values are transferred from other sources, other lines in the MFR form, or are carryover from the prior year. This makes it easier to complete the form, compare prior year data with the current year, and quickly identify large variances and possible errors.\nSources of auto-filled lines:\n- DOR VAULT System\n- Municipal Treasurer's Settlement (MTS)\n- Statement of Taxes (SOT)\n- State Payment Register\n- Other lines in the current and prior MFR form\nAuto-filled values can be changed, and if changed, a warning appears requiring an explanation or additional documentation to support the change."

    },
    {
      "Q": "What assessment data does an outgoing assessor need to provide to the municipality?",
      "A": "The outgoing assessor must provide the municipality with all assessment records (paper and electronic) in the assessor's custody. Even though an assessor must maintain electronic assessment data, the assessor must also provide the municipality with a paper copy of each property record card if requested. If paper records are converted to an electronic format, the assessor must return the original paper records to the municipality.\nIf the outgoing assessor used a proprietary assessment system, the outgoing assessor must provide the data to the municipality in two formats:\n- The format native to the customized or uncommon software\n- ​A non-proprietary format (comma delimited text, MS-Access, DB2, SQL, XML).

      "Q": "What is the maximum amount a town, village, city or county can levy?",
      "A": "Towns, villages, cities and counties use the Levy Limit Worksheet to determine the maximum allowable property tax levy they can implement without potentially receiving a penalty under state law (sec. 66.0602 , Wis. Stats.).\nOn the Levy Limit Worksheet (Forms SL-202M and SL-202C)\n- Your allowable levy is the amount in Section A, Line 10\n- Line 10 is the sum of Line 8 (levy limit before adjustments less personal property aid) and Line 9 (total adjustments from Section D)\nSpecial resolution (Form SL-202M)\n- If a town with a population less than 3,000 approves a levy limit increase by special resolution, it must enter the total town tax levy (including the increase approved by the town electors) in Section A, Line 11\n- The amount on Line 11 is your allowable levy"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where do I report the actual levy on the Levy Limit Worksheet?",
      "A": "Your actual levy is not reported on the Levy Limit Worksheet. Municipalities should report their actual levy on the Statement of Taxes (SOT). Counties report their actual levy on the State and County Apportionment form (SCTA).\nThe Levy Limit Worksheet is used to calculate and report the allowable levy limit. Even if your actual levy is less than your allowable levy limit, you must submit your Levy Limit Worksheet showing your allowable levy limit. Your actual levy is reported on your SOT or SCTA."

      "Q": "Do I need to complete the Levy Limit Worksheet if there are no adjustments to our allowable levy?",
      "A": "Yes. Each county and municipality must submit a Levy Limit Worksheet to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) by December 15 of each year. You should review your allowable levy limit before adjustments, shown in Section A, Line 8, to ensure your municipality's or county's property tax levy is less than or equal to the allowable levy limit. If there are no adjustments, you would enter $0 on all adjustment lines in Section D, and submit the auto-filled worksheet to DOR."

    {
      "Q": "Does completing the adjustment request affect the amount of personal property aid the TID receives?",
      "A": "No, a TID's personal property aid is determined by its 2023 personal property value. The TID personal property adjustment request only affects the TID's base value."
    },

This amount can be zero. It cannot be greater than the amount in the \"Allowable Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\" column.\nThe municipality should review the Statement of Taxes for the TIDAR reporting year to determine how much the municipality levied. Then review the Levy Limit Worksheet for the same year to determine the allowable levy.\n- If the municipality levied the full amount allowed, then the \"Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\" is likely the same as the \"Allowable Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\"\n- If the municipality levied less than the full amount allowed, it must determine how much of the levied amount  was due to TID net new construction. The reason the municipality levied less than the allowable amount may affect how a municipality determines the \"Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\" amount.\n- When the \"Allowable Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\" is zero or negative, the form auto-fills \"0\" in \"Levy Increase Attributable to TID Net New Construction\"\n- If there are multiple TIDs, the number entered on the first report filed will auto-fill on each future Annual Report\nThe TID Annual Report is informational only.

      "A": "No. Under state law, penalty payments are not an allowable TID expenditure."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the Joint Review Board (JRB) need to meet before the municipality e-files the TID Annual Report(s)?",
      "A": "No. Under state law, the JRB must meet on July 1 or when the report becomes available. The law does not state whether the meeting must occur before or after e-filing the report with DOR."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality schedules the JRB meeting, can the municipality email the TID Annual Report(s) to the JRB before the meeting?",
      "A": "Yes. State law requires the municipality to provide the JRB copies of the report. However, state law does not require a municipality to provide the report before the meeting and does not require a specific distribution method.\nState law requires the JRB meet to review the report and the TID's status/performance. For each JRB meeting, the municipality must publish a notice at least five days before it holds the meeting. At the meeting, it may be helpful to provide paper copies of the report."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the JRB need to vote to approve or reject the annual reports, or does it just need to review the Annual Reports?",
      "A": "State law only requires the JRB meet to review the reports. The JRB does not need to adopt a resolution approving or rejecting the reports."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality need to provide DOR with documentation stating the JRB met to review the TID Annual Report?",
      "A": "No. The municipality should keep a record of the JRB meeting notice and minutes in its TID files."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality update its TID Annual Report after the report is submitted?",
      "A": "Yes. After filing an original TID Annual R​eport, a municipality may amend the report in My DOR Government Account through November 1."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When an error is found in a TID Annual Report after the amendment deadline of November 1, how should a municipality correct the report?",
      "A": "After discovering an error in the TID Annual Report, a municipality should present the corrected report at the next JRB meeting and have revised numbers available for the public upon request. The original published report remains on DOR's website for seven years."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality settles a claim on a property within a TID and issues a tax refund, how should the tax refund be reported on Form PE-300?",
      "A": "Property tax refunds are not an eligible TID project cost. Do not include a property tax refund on the TID Annual Report (Form PE-300). Eligible TID project costs are defined in sec. 66.1105(2)(f) , Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are TID statistical reports available?",
      "A": "Yes. Review the DOR reports web page and select the category \"Tax Incremental Financing\" for information, including yearly data, active TIDs, value limit, and changes in TID values."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is a base value redetermination?",
      "A": "A base value redetermination is a type of amendment. A municipality may amend a Tax Incremental District (TID) to request that DOR reduce the TID's base value to its current value. To qualify, the TID's current year value must be at least 10% below the TID's base value for two consecutive years."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When redetermining a base value, does the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) use the Tax Incremental District's (TID's) current equalized value or the TID's lowest historic value to set the new base value?",
      "A": "DOR sets the new base value to the TID's equalized value as of the date of the municipality's redetermination resolution."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What years should the municipality use to determine the equalized values two-year, 10% decline?",
      "A": "Use the two most current years available based on when the municipality adopts the redetermination resolution.\nIf the municipality adopts the resolution:\n- Between January 1 and August 14 — use the prior two years' values\n- On or after August 15 through December 31 — use the current year value and prior year value"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What steps must a municipality complete for a base value redetermination amendment?",
      "A": "The municipality must:\n- Revise the project plan\n- Hold the required meetings and a public hearing\n- Adopt the necessary resolutions\nSee the TIF Base Value Redetermination web page for the required steps. See the TID Checklist for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "The amended project plan requires selecting Option (3), (4) or (5) from sec.66.1105(5)(i), Wis. Stats. What impact do these three options have on the project plan?",
      "A": "Option 3 - (sec. 66.1105(5)(i)3. )\n- At least 51% of the public  infrastructure improvement's value must be financed by a private developer or entity\n- Development agreement is required to receive cash grants which will solely repay the developer or entity for public infrastructure costs\nOption 4 - (sec. 66.1105(5)(i)4. )\n- Municipality expects to pay all project costs within 90% of the TID's remaining life\nOption 5 - (sec. 66.1105(5)(i)5. )\n- Expenditures may be made only within the first half of the TID's maximum life\n- Joint Review Board can unanimously approve additional expenditures but not beyond the original expenditure period"
    },
    {
      "Q": "In Option (4), do the project costs which must be paid within 90% of the TID's remaining life, include debt service?",
      "A": "Yes. The amended project plan must demonstrate the TID will have sufficient revenue to pay off debt and all project costs within 90% of the TID's remaining life. After all project costs are paid, the municipality must terminate the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In Option (4), how is the TID's remaining life calculated?",
      "A": "- Determine the TID's maximum life (review the Active TIDs report)\n- Determine the TID's redetermination year: Municipal resolution adopted January 1 to September 30 — redetermination year is the year the resolution is adopted Municipal resolution adopted October 1 to December 31 — redetermination year is the year after the year the resolution is adopted\n- Municipal resolution adopted January 1 to September 30 — redetermination year is the year the resolution is adopted\n- Municipal resolution adopted October 1 to December 31 — redetermination year is the year after the year the resolution is adopted\n- Subtract the redetermination year from the maximum life year\n- Multiply the difference by (0.9)\n- Add the result to the TID's redetermination year\nExample:\n- Municipality adopted a resolution to create a mixed-use on TID April 1, 2017; the maximum life is April 1, 2037\n- Municipal redetermination resolution is adopted April 1, 2019; this is a 2019 redetermination\n- 2037 (maximum life) – 2019 (redetermination year) = 18 years of life remaining\n- 18 X (0.9) = 16 years is 90% of the remaining life\n- 2019 (redetermination year) + 16 years = 2035; the municipality must pay all costs and adopt a termination resolution by April 1, 2035"
    },
    {
      "Q": "In Option (5), do \"expenditures\" include debt service?",
      "A": "No. With this option, the municipality may only take on project costs within the first half of the TID's maximum life. Debt payments may continue through the TID's maximum life. Also, see Municipal Expenditures and Debt Common Question 1 ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the difference between \"all project costs\" in Option (4) and \"expenditures\" in Option (5)?",
      "A": "State law (sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats.), does not provide a specific definition of expenditures; however, DOR considers an expenditure to include any eligible project cost at the point it is incurred. It does not include repayment of debt for an eligible project cost."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality completes a base value redetermination amendment, how would the change affect the equalized value used for the apportionment of taxes?",
      "A": "The municipality's equalized value, minus the TID increment value, is used for the apportionment of taxes. When the TID's base value is reduced through a redetermination amendment, it may increase the TID's increment value. An increased TID increment value could reduce the municipality's equalized value used for the apportionment of taxes."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality with an Environmental Remediation (ER) TID request a base value redetermination?",
      "A": "Only an ER TID created after November 29, 2017, under sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats., is eligible for a redetermination if it meets the decrement criteria (TID's current year value is at least 10% below the base value for two consecutive years). An ER TID created under sec. 66.1106 , Wis. Stats., is not eligible."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality with a distressed (or severely distressed) TID request a base value redetermination?",
      "A": "Yes. A distressed (or severely distressed) TID is eligible for a redetermination if it meets the decrement criteria (the TID's current year value is at least 10% below the base value for two consecutive years)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality include new project costs with the base value redetermination amendment?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality must adopt a revised project plan as part of the base value redetermination amendment. The revised project plan may include new projects, but the plan must show the TID meets the decrement criteria and select Option (3), (4) or (5). The new costs must meet the requirements of the Option (3), (4) or (5) selected in the revised plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When is the deadline to request a TID base value redetermination with DOR?",
      "A": "The municipality must adopt a municipal resolution on or before September 30 of the amendment year and email the redetermination documents to DOR by October 31. DOR will provide the municipality the redetermined base value in the following year.\nExample: The municipality adopts the redetermination resolution by September 30, 2026, and submits the required redetermination documents to DOR by October 31, 2026. DOR notifies the municipality of the new base value by March 2027. The redetermined base value is in effect for tax year 2027.\nRedetermination documents include:\n- Decrement worksheet showing the 10% decline for the past two years\n- Form PE-605B with required documents\n- Updated project plan\nSee Base Value Redetermination for additional information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality request that the JRB adopt resolutions to extend a TID and complete a base value redetermination amendment for the same TID at the same time?",
      "A": "Yes. If the TID meets the extension criteria (see TID Extension Types ) and the decrement criteria, the municipality may request the JRB approve both at the same time. An extension changes the amount of time allowed for options (4 or 5) from sec. 66.1105(5)(i), Wis. Stats., explained in question 4 ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What entities can create a Tax Incremental District (TID)?",

      "Q": "Can a city, village, or town create a joint TID?",
      "A": "Yes. Two or more municipalities may enter into an intergovernmental cooperative agreement to jointly create a multijurisdictional TID , under state law (sec. 66.1105(18) , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How long does it take to create a new TID?",
      "A": "Generally, the process requires a minimum of two months at the local level. The time required depends on how often the municipality meets and how long it takes to develop the TID​'s project plan and boundaries."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What documents are required to create a municipal TID?",
      "A": "All required TID creation documents are listed in the Due date/process section of the TIF Municipal Creation web page and must be emailed to tif@wisconsin.gov by October 31 of the creation year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When is the TID creation deadline?",
      "A": "The local legislative body must adopt the creation resolution by September  30 and email the required documents to tif@wisconsin.gov by October 31 of the creation year. DOR emails a base value certification letter by March of the following year. The municipality receives its first tax increment dollars the year after the certification.\nSee TID Creation Timeframes ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the Planning Commission have to hold a public hearing?",
      "A": "Yes. If the municipality does not have a Planning Commission, it must create one following sec. 62.23 , Wis. Stats., or designate another authority to act in that capacity (ex: Community Development Authority (CDA) or Redevelopment Authority)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the Planning Commission is only an advisory board to the municipality and does not have authority to pass resolutions, what should the Planning Commission provide?",
      "A": "Provide a copy of the Planning Commission meeting minutes, documenting approval to both:\n- Local legislative body\n- DOR (as part of the TID documents)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the Planning Commission denies a municipality's proposal to create a new TID, can the local legislative body overrule the Planning Commission and approve the TID?",
      "A": "No. The Planning Commission must adopt a project plan for a proposed TID before the local legislative body can approve the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do we need to adjust the maps in the project plan if the municipality approves different boundaries than those recommended by the Planning Commission?",
      "A": "Yes. The maps in the final project plan must reflect the boundaries approved by the municipality and the Joint Review Board."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there requirements for resolution wording?",
      "A": "Yes. See the Resolution Checklist for the requirements for each resolution (Planning Commission, local legislative body and Joint Review Board)."

    {
      "Q": "Is a two-thirds majority required to pass each of the resolutions to create a TID (Planning Commission, local legislative body and Joint Review Board)?",
      "A": "No, a two-thirds majority is not required. Each resolution must be passed by a simple majority of members."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the municipality hold one public hearing when several TIDs are being created at the same time?",
      "A": "Yes. However, the public hearing notice must list each creation separately and the municipality must adopt a separate resolution for each TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a property owner exclude their property from a TID?",
      "A": "A property owner can request municipal officials exclude their property from a TID during the creation process. However, the municipality is not required to exclude that property.\nIf their property is already located within a TID, the property owner can request the municipality complete a territory subtraction amendment to have their property removed from the TID. However​ the municipality is not required to complete a subtraction to remove the property.\nNote: The property in a TID is assessed the same way as property outside a TID. The municipal tax rate is the same whether the property is in or out of a TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What year is used for the base value of parcels in a TID?",
      "A": "For a creation resolution adopted between October 1, 2025, and September 30, 2026, use the assessment as of January 1, 2026. Use the assessed values as of the final adjournment by that year's Board of Review (BOR). Do not complete the Base Value Workbook until after the BOR."

      "Q": "What are the TID types?",
      "A": "The municipality creating the TID must declare a type in the resolution based on the type of property in the TID at the time of creation. See the Tax Incremental Finance (TIF) Manual , Section 1.5 Glossary, for definitions of each type.\nMunicipal TID types (created under sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats.):\n- Blight\n- Rehabilitation/conservation\n- Industrial\n- Mixed-use\n- Environmental Remediation (local legislative body resolution adopted on or after November 29, 2017)\nEnvironmental Remediation TID type (created under sec. 66.1106 , Wis. Stats. — local legislative body resolution adopted before November 29, 2017).\nTown TID  types (created under sec. 60.85 , Wis. Stats.):\n- Tourism\n- Agriculture\n- Forest\n- Manufacturing"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does a municipality calculate the percentage of property to determine the TID type?",
      "A": "When creating a municipal TID (under sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats.), at least 50% of all TID property must be one of the following types:\n- Blighted\n- In need of rehabilitation/conservation\n- Suitable for industrial uses\n- Suitable for mixed-use\n- In need of environmental remediation\nTo calculate the percentage, divide the acreage of all real property determined to be a specific type by the total acreage of the TID. The total TID acreage includes roads and exempt property.\nWhen creating a town TID (under sec. 60.85 , Wis. Stats.), at least 75% of all TID property must be used for single project type: agriculture, forestry, manufacturing or tourism."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where do I find specific information on the different TID types?",
      "A": "See the TID Criteria Matrix for TID life, standard extension, overlap option and expenditure period for each TID type."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What determines the TID's maximum life?",
      "A": "The TID's maximum life is based on the creation date and the TID type. The creation date is the date the local legislative body adopted the creation resolution. The TID type is declared in the resolution. See the TID Criteria Matrix ."

    {
      "Q": "Is the municipality required to send a copy of the developer's agreement to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR)?",
      "A": "No. The municipality does not need to send the agreement to DOR. However, state law requires the municipality to send a copy of the developer's agreement to the Joint Review Board (JRB). After the TID is terminated, the municipality must save the agreement in the official TID records."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When must the public hearing notice include the cash grant reference? Is an amount required?",
      "A": "If the proposed project plan includes cash grants, the municipality must state this information in the published hearing notice under state law (sec. 66.1105(4)(e) , Wis. Stats.). The hearing notice does not need to include the purpose of the cash grant or list the exact amount."
    },
    {
      "Q": "A municipality included cash grants in the original project plan. The municipality is now amending the plan. Does the municipality need to repeat the cash grant reference if no new cash grants are being added to the plan?",
      "A": "State law does not require the cash grant wording in this situation. However, continuing to include the cash grants information in public hearing notices provides consistent information to taxpayers."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who makes the decision on what to include in a developer's agreement?",
      "A": "The municipality and its attorney decide what information to include in the developer's agreement."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the developer's agreement need to be finalized before the TID's creation resolution is adopted?",
      "A": "No. The developer's agreement does not need to be finalized before the municipality adopts the creation resolution. However, the municipality must include:\n- The developer incentive amount as a cost in the approved project plan\n- A statement about the developer incentive in the public hearing notice"

    {
      "Q": "What extension types are available for Tax Incremental Districts (TIDs)?",
      "A": "There are three types of extensions: Standard, Technical College, and Affordable Housing. Each extension has different requirements and exclusions.\n- Standard – allows an extension (three or four years from the TID's maximum life, depending on TID type) if existing tax increments will not pay project costs within the TID maximum life\n- Technical College – allows a three-year extension to the TID's maximum life if tax increments were negatively impacted by 2013 Act 145. The Act increased state aid to technical colleges and may have caused a decrease in tax increment revenue for some TIDs.\n- Affordable Housing – allows an extension, up to one year from the resolution date, if the municipality uses the final year's increment to benefit affordable housing"
    },
    {
      "Q": "To extend the life of a TID, is the municipality required to complete the amendment process?",
      "A": "No. The municipality is not required to complete the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) amendment forms or provide DOR an updated project plan. However, a municipality must document that the TID needs extra time to pay off existing debt or the TID has paid all its project costs and would like one additional year for affordable housing. The municipality must provide DOR an approved resolution for each extension type."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When extending a TID's life, what documents must a municipality provide to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR)?",
      "A": "When the extension resolution is adopted, the municipality must email a scanned copy of the resolution to tif@wisconsin.gov. DOR then extends the TID life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality adopts an extension resolution to change the maximum life, does this change the expenditure period?",
      "A": "No. An extension does not change the expenditure period. The expenditure period is five years shorter than the maximum life without the extension. For more information, see Municipal Expenditures and Debt Common Question 2 ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For the Standard or Technical College extension, is the Joint Review Board (JRB) the only body that needs to approve the extension?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality must either present the JRB with documents showing the TID cannot repay project costs within its maximum life or provide the JRB with an independent audit. The JRB must adopt a resolution approving the extension."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a distressed TID eligible for the Standard or Technical College extension?",
      "A": "Yes, a TID designated distressed may be extended using a Standard or Technical College extension, if the TID meets the requirements for these extensions. See TID Extension Types to determine if the TID is eligible."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is an industrial TID created between 1995 and 2004 eligible for the Standard extension?",
      "A": "No. The law has no Standard extension for industrial TIDs created between 1995 and 2004. A municipality could consider requesting the Technical College extension if it needs more time to pay off a TID's existing debt. Other TID types not eligible for the Standard extension are listed in the TID Extension Types matrix."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality request a Technical College extension for a TID created before 2014 if it added project costs after 2014?",
      "A": "Yes. If the TID was created before October​ 1, 2014, a municipality can request the three-year Technical College extension regardless of when the project costs were incurred or updated."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is the municipality required to inform the JRB when it adopts an Affordable Housing resolution to extend the TID an additional year?",
      "A": "No. The law does not require the municipality to notify the JRB; however, it would be beneficial for the municipality to inform the JRB of the Affordable Housing extension."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When can a municipality request the Affordable Housing extension?",
      "A": "A municipality can adopt an Affordable Housing extension resolution after it pays all the TID project costs. The Affordable Housing extension resolution must state the year the final tax increment was (or will be) received and describe how the funds will be used for affordable housing. The resolution can extend the TID's life for up to one year from the resolution date. The municipality must adopt a separate termination resolution before receiving an additional year's increment. April 15 is the deadline for a municipality to terminate a TID and have it removed from the same year's tax roll. Review the Termination Timeframes table for additional details."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality adopt all three extension resolutions at the same time?",
      "A": "No. The Standard and Technical College extensions are designed to allow more time to pay existing costs and debt. These extension resolutions can be adopted at the same time; however, a municipality cannot adopt an Affordable Housing extension resolution until all costs are paid. See TID Options Near Max Life document for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality considering the Standard and Technical College extensions have to adopt both at the same time (before the maximum life)?",
      "A": "No. If the TID meets the criteria for both extension types, the municipality can adopt one of the extension resolutions and consider another before the end of the TID's extended life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is the JRB required to approve a Technical College extension for three years or can it approve the extension for one or two years?",
      "A": "If the municipality provides an independent audit demonstrating the need for the extension, the JRB must approve the extension for three years.\nIf the municipality does not provide an independent audit, the JRB can deny or approve the three-year extension. When the JRB approves an extension of less than three years or denies the extension entirely, the municipality may complete an independent audit to show the full three years are needed.\nIf the TID does not need the full three-year extension, the municipality can terminate the TID before the TID's extended life date."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a municipality limited to using the affordable housing funds within the TID boundary?",
      "A": "No. The funds can be used anywhere in the municipality; however, at least 75% must be used for affordable housing and the remainder on housing in general."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is affordable housing?",
      "A": "State law defines \"affordable housing\" as housing that costs a household no more than 30% of the household's gross monthly income."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality consider additional restrictions on the housing? For example, can a municipality require residents to make less than the average household income?",
      "A": "Yes, if the housing meets state law, the municipality can include additional requirements. A municipality should consult its attorney to confirm the proposed restrictions comply with state law."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does DOR have a list of eligible affordable housing costs?",
      "A": "No. Each municipality must identify its affordable housing needs and develop a plan for the funds. State law requires a municipality to use the funds for affordable housing and to describe how it will use the funds in its affordable housing extension resolution. The municipality should consult its attorney to determine whether the planned costs comply with state law."

    {
      "Q": "What are some examples of how municipalities use affordable housing funds?",
      "A": "Some municipalities set aside the affordable housing funds for large affordable housing developments. Others establish a revolving loan or grant program to increase home ownership or improve existing affordable housing. Each municipality should review its affordable housing needs and develop a plan for the funds before the TID reaches its maximum life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a municipality required to use the affordable housing funds within one year?",
      "A": "No. However, the municipality must remove the money from the TID fund to terminate the TID. The municipality should keep the funds for affordable housing use separate."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality extending a TID for affordable housing use the TID's final shared revenue payments (exempt computer or personal property aid) for affordable housing?",
      "A": "No. State law refers to using the final increment for affordable housing and does not mention using shared revenue payments for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality extending a TID for affordable housing use more than one year of increment for affordable housing, or use the entire surplus in the TID fund for affordable housing?",
      "A": "No. The municipality may only use the amount of the final year's tax increment for affordable housing."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality extending a TID for affordable housing use a portion of the final increment to pay off costs and the remainder for affordable housing?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality must still follow all requirements for the affordable housing extension.\n- Use at least 75% of the amount set aside for affordable housing and the remaining 25% on housing in general\n- Adopt a resolution describing how it will use the funds and provide the resolution to DOR\n- Uses $50,000 to pay remaining TID project costs (ex: final audit costs)\n- Uses the remaining $200,000 for the affordable housing extension 75% (or $150,000) must be used on affordable housing 25% (or $50,000) may be used on housing in general\n- 75% (or $150,000) must be used on affordable housing\n- 25% (or $50,000) may be used on housing in general"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a TID eligible for the Affordable Housing extension if its life was extended for other reasons (ex: declared distressed, donor to distressed, granted a Standard extension or Technical College extension)?",
      "A": "Yes. A TID that was extended for other reasons is eligible for the Affordable Housing extension; however, only TIDs created under sec. 66.1105, Wis. Stats. are eligible for the Affordable Housing extension. Town TIDs (created under sec. 60.85, Wis. Stats.) and ER TIDs (created under sec. 66.1106, Wis. Stats.) are not eligible."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality adopt one resolution that includes both an Affordable Housing extension and the TID termination?",
      "A": "No. A municipality must adopt separate resolutions. The Affordable Housing extension resolution must state the length of the extension, not to exceed 12 months from the date of the resolution. Before the Affordable Housing extension period ends, the municipality must adopt a separate termination resolution. The termination resolution formally ends the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does DOR have a list of TIDs that were extended?",
      "A": "The Active TIDs report includes a column for the Life Extended date. Any TID with an extension shows a date in this column, which is the end of the TID's extension period."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the  difference between TIF and a Tax Incremental District (TID)?",
      "A": "- TIF — an economic development technique to expand the property tax base. Property value increases fund site improvements that would not otherwise occur.\n- TID — the actual physical area (whole parcels) designated for improvements using tax incremental financing"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the Wisconsin  Department of Revenue's (DOR) role?",
      "A": "- TIF is intended to be locally initiated and managed, with minimal State oversight. However, DOR cannot certify a tax incremental base until we determine procedures were followed, documents were completed correctly, and notices were provided timely.\n- Facts supporting any document adopted or action taken by the local governing body are not subject to review by DOR. The municipality's documents and proposed project costs must comply with state law. A municipality is encouraged to consult an attorney and auditor with any questions.\n- If you have questions about a specific project in a TID, contact the municipality or the members of the Joint Review Board (JRB) that approved the TID project plan and boundaries"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What statutes regulate TIF?",
      "A": "- Village and city​ — sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats.\n- Town — sec. 60.85 and sec. 60.23(32) , Wis. Stats.\n- Environmental remediation (municipal resolution adopted before November 29, 2017) — sec. 66.1106 , Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is TIF  funded?",
      "A": "When a TID is created, the municipality and other taxing jurisdictions agree to support their normal operations from the existing tax base within the district. Property taxes for the school, county, technical college, and municipality are based on the taxable value of the TID at the time it is created.\nThe municipality funds development through the increases to the property values in the TID.  The taxes on the TID value increment (the difference between the TID's current value and the TID's base value), results in additional revenues collected for the district's fund. The municipality must use the funds to pay eligible TID costs. When costs are paid and the municipality closes the TID, the increased tax base is shared with all taxing jurisdictions.\nThe State of Wisconsin does not collect or pay tax increments to municipal governments."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Besides a municipality, what are the other taxing jurisdictions?",
      "A": "The other taxing jurisdictions are the school district, county, and technical college. A municipality may also have a lake district, sanitary district or metro sewer district."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there limits on the use of TIF?",
      "A": "Yes. State law limits a municipality's ability  to create new TIDs and add property to existing TIDs. The equalized value of property in the TID, plus the value increment of all existing TIDs cannot exceed 12% of the total municipal equalized value. This restriction does not apply to an Environmental Remediation TID created under sec. 66.1106 , Wis. Stats., or when subtracting territory from a TID. For more information, review the Value Limit Common Questions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the TID maximum life with or without extensions?",
      "A": "The TID maximum life without an extension depends on the TID type declared in the creation resolution and the date the municipality adopted the resolution. For more information on the maximum life without an extension for each type, see the TID Criteria Matrix .\nThe municipality can approve an extension as a separate resolution later in a TID's life. The TID maximum life with an extension depends on the extension type. See TID Extension Types for extensions available including the length."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How can I obtain information (ex: map, parcels) about a specific TID or TIDs throughout the state?",
      "A": "Contact the municipality where the TID is located for information on a specific TID. Visit the DOR Reports page for yearly statewide TID reports; select \" Tax Incremental Financing \" as the category."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When property is in a TID, does that change how the property assessment is determined?",
      "A": "No. Property in a TID is assessed the same way as other taxable property. See the DOR Guide for Property Owners for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What fees are involved with having a TID and how does a municipality pay them?",
      "A": "Municipality must pay the following fees electronically through My Tax Account : Due by October 31 – once per request\n- Creation: $1,000\n- Territory Amendment (addition or subtraction): $1,000\n- Territory Amendment (addition and subtraction): $2,000\n- Base Value Redetermination: $1,000\nDue by April 15 – yearly\n- Administrative fee: $150 per active TID\nDOR does not accept paper checks for TID fees."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When are reports and documents due?",
      "A": "Due dates:\n- July 1 — TID Annual Report (late fee of $100 per TID per day applicable after grace period) – e-file Form PE-300 through MyDORGov\n- October 31 — Creations, Territory Amendments, and Base Value Redeterminations – email required documents to tif@wisconsin.gov\n- December 31 — Project Plan and/or Allocation Amendments – email required documents to tif@wisconsin.gov\nSee TID Dates and Requirements for additional information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the Joint Review Board?",
      "A": "The Joint Review Board (JRB) oversees a Tax Incremental District (TID). The JRB consists of one representative from each taxation jurisdiction within the specific TID (school district, technical college, county, municipality) and one public member."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does the initial JRB meeting for a creation or amendment have to be held?",
      "A": "The initial JRB meeting must be held within 14 days after the public hearing notice is published."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do the JRB meetings require a published notice?",
      "A": "Yes. For all JRB meetings, the municipality with the TID must publish a notice in a local newspaper, at least five days before the meeting."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality creates a TID in two counties, which county has a representative on the JRB?",
      "A": "The county with the greatest value in the TID is represented on the JRB."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If there are two lake districts in a TID, which one should have a representative on the JRB?",
      "A": "Neither. Only the school, county, technical college and municipality can appoint JRB representatives. However, the municipality must notify all affected taxing jurisdictions of the public hearing, including the lake districts."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If there is an elementary and union high school district, which one has a representative on the JRB?",
      "A": "A representative from the elementary school and a representative from the union high school share one seat and each have one-half a vote."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality amends a TID with additional territory that includes a new school district or county, should the new school district or county have a representative on the JRB?",
      "A": "A territory amendment requires a new calculation to determine which of the school districts or counties in the TID has the majority of the land value. Whichever has the majority, has the voting representation on the JRB. The calculation to determine majority value is the existing base value plus the additional parcels' current value.\n- If the amendment does not change the district with the majority value – the current standing JRB approves the amendment\n- If the amendment changes the district with the majority value and the municipality does not have a standing JRB with that district in the majority – the municipality must form a new standing JRB. The new JRB, including the representative from the district with majority value, approves the amendment.\n- If the amendment changes the district with the majority value and the municipality has a standing JRB with that district in the majority – the standing JRB, represented by the district with majority value, approves the amendment"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a TID is created, how are the JRB's chairperson and public member determined?",
      "A": "The JRB members, by majority vote, choose the chairperson and public member. If the representative acting as chairperson resigns from the JRB, the members must elect a new chairperson by majority vote. If the public member resigns, the JRB must choose a new public member by majority vote."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How soon can a JRB approve/deny a resolution after the local legislative body adopts the resolution?",
      "A": "- For Municipal TIDs - the JRB must approve/deny a resolution anytime within 45 days after receiving the resolution from the local legislative body\n- For Town TIDs created under sec 60.85, Wis. Stats., or Environmental Remediation TIDs created under sec. 66.1106, Wis. Stats. - the JRB must approve or deny a resolution within 10-45 days after receiving the resolution from the local legislative body"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a Tax Incremental District (TID) creation need unanimous JRB approval?",
      "A": "No. Only a majority approval vote is required."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is the majority vote based on all the JRB members or only the members who attend the meeting?",
      "A": "A majority of all JRB members must approve the TID. Therefore, except for a multijurisdictional TID, at least three \"yes\" votes are required. Any member who cannot attend a meeting should appoint a delegate to attend and vote on their behalf. Any member who does not attend or send a delegate is considered a \"no\" vote."
    },
    {
      "Q": "After the JRB adopts the resolution, how soon does the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) need to be notified?",
      "A": "Under state law (sec. 66.1105(5)(cm) , Wis. Stats.), the municipal clerk must give DOR written notice within 60 days of adopting any amendment resolution. Although state law does not require this same notice for a creation resolution, municipalities should also notify DOR within 60 days."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How often does the JRB need to meet after the TID is created?",
      "A": "At a minimum, the JRB must meet annually to review the TID's annual report, performance and status. The JRB must also meet to consider any amendments to the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the JRB need to vote to select a chairperson and public member at each year's meeting or when amending a TID?",
      "A": "No. Once the chairperson and public member are selected, no new vote is required. The chairperson and public member remain the same until they are no longer on the board."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How many JRB members need to attend the meeting for it to take place?",
      "A": "At least one-half of the members must attend a meeting. When one-half or more of the members of a governmental body attend, a meeting is assumed to be for official purposes (sec. 19.82(2) , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are the JRB members required to attend meetings in person?",
      "A": "Due to the complexity of TID project plans, meeting in person is considered best practice. However, JRB members may participate in meetings via telephone or video conference, if communication is two-way, so votes and comments can be heard by all attendees. JRB members may not vote by email. The municipality should consult its attorney to confirm JRB meetings and notices comply with open meetings law.\nFor more information, review the Joint Review Board section of the TIF Manual."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where should the JRB meetings be held?",
      "A": "When creating or amending a TID, the municipality should hold the JRB meeting locally so the affected members of the public can easily attend. The municipality should consider allowing both in-person and virtual options for the same meeting. This allows the public to attend using the method they prefer.\nWhen reviewing the TID annual reports, the meeting may be held by one of the taxing jurisdictions (school, county, technical college) to review the reports from multiple municipalities."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality email correspondence to JRB members?",
      "A": "Yes, since state law does not define a distribution method for materials a municipality provides to JRB members."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Since the JRB for any active TID is already established, does it still need to hold an organizational meeting when amending a TID?",
      "A": "Yes. Under state law, (sec. 66.1105(4m)(a) , Wis. Stats.), the JRB must hold its first meeting to review the proposal within 14 days after the public hearing notice is published.  The organizational meeting provides the public an opportunity to learn about the amendment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality has a standing JRB but is creating a new TID, should it reappoint a chairperson and public member for the new TID?",
      "A": "The answer depends on whether the new TID includes the same overlying taxing jurisdictions (ex: school district, county and technical college) as the standing JRB. Each combination of taxing jurisdictions must have a separate JRB.\n- Same overlying taxing jurisdictions as an existing TID – the existing (standing) JRB governs the new TID. The standing JRB does not appoint a new chairperson or public representative. Exception: The standing JRB must appoint a new chairperson or public representative when the position becomes vacant due to a resignation.\n- Different overlying taxing jurisdictions than any existing TIDs – the JRB members for the new TID's taxing jurisdictions must elect the chairperson and public member, by majority vote, at the first meeting"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a taxing jurisdiction replaces their representative, do other members of the JRB have to approve the change?",
      "A": "No. Each taxing jurisdiction appoints a representative and can replace that representative when necessary without approval from the other JRB members."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are the criteria for selecting a public member?",
      "A": "State law does not define any requirements for the public member. The JRB members, by majority vote, choose the public member at the JRB's first meeting. A public member can be appointed as the JRB chairperson."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the public member be employed by the municipality or county?",
      "A": "Yes. A public member may work for municipal, county, state or federal government."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the public member need to live in the same municipality as the TID?",
      "A": "No. State law does not require the public member to live in the same municipality as the proposed TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the expected termination year? Why is the JRB required to determine this year?",
      "A": "Starting with TIDs that have a 2025 base year, state law (sec. 66.1105(4m)(b)2m. , Wis. Stats.) requires the JRB establish the year it expects the TID to terminate. This year may be different than the TID's statutory maximum life determined by the TID type and when the municipality adopted the creation resolution. When the TID terminates, the TID's actual life compared to the JRB's expected life, based on the expected termination year, determines whether the municipality receives an additional levy adjustment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is an expenditure?",
      "A": "The term \"expenditure\" is found within the definition of project costs under state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1., Wis. Stats.). Expenditure is not defined; however, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) considers an expenditure any eligible project cost at the point it is incurred. It does not include repayment of debt for an eligible project cost."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the expenditure period?",
      "A": "It is the maximum time period a TID can incur expenses related to the project plan. Generally, it is five years shorter than the maximum life. A municipality cannot take on any new projects after the end of the expenditure period. An extension does not change the expenditure period.\nReview the TID Criteria Matrix for the expenditure period by TID type."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What date is used to measure the start of the expenditure period?",
      "A": "The date the local legislative body adopts the creation resolution is the start of the expenditure period."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can \"new\" project costs be incurred after the expenditure period?",
      "A": "No. Existing projects may be finished but no additional improvements can be started during the last five years of the TID's maximum life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is considered an existing project?",
      "A": "- Project must be documented in the JRB approved project plan, and\n- Either the physical project is started, or one of the following must be in place: Established financing for the project​ Signed contract Signed developer's agreement\n- Established financing for the project​\n- Signed contract\n- Signed developer's agreement"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can payments be made after the expenditure period?",
      "A": "Yes. Payments for project cost debt service, repayment of advances or other liabilities and approved allocations to other TIDs are allowed under state law (sec. 66.1105(6)(c) , Wis. Stats.). Costs for professional services, administration, and DOR fees required to maintain the TID are also allowed."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality request an extension to a TID's expenditure period?",
      "A": "No. State law does not allow extensions to a TID's expenditure period. A municipality must incur project expenditures before the expenditure period ends."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there any restrictions on the length of maturity for TID debt?",
      "A": "No. The same restrictions for other municipal debt apply to TID debt and would likely not mature beyond the TID's maximum life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality transfer money from another fund into a TID fund and repay itself later?",
      "A": "Yes. It can also charge a reasonable interest cost for advances to a TID fund if made after the TID is created."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality incurs expenses before it creates a Tax Incremental District (TID), can these expenses be recovered?",
      "A": "If a municipality incurs expenses before it creates a TID, the municipality can only recover expenses directly related to planning the district. The municipality cannot incur other expenses until after the municipality adopts the creation resolution approving the project plan. (sec. 66.1105(6)(am)3. , Wis. Stats.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What expenses can be considered \"planning\" expenses?",
      "A": "State law does not define planning expenses; however, the consulting, legal, engineering, architectural or administrative costs required to develop and approve the project plan may qualify. The municipality should consult its attorney for assistance to determine if a specific cost is considered a planning expense."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality purchased property before it creates a TID and sells the property after the TID is approved, can the property purchase be considered a TID expense?",
      "A": "No. The property purchase is not an eligible TID expense. The purchase occurred before the TID was approved and is not a planning expense.\nIf a municipality purchases property within one year before the TID creation, when setting the TID base value the land must be valued as if the purchase did not occur. (sec. 66.1105(5)(e) , Wis. Stats.)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality purchased property before it creates a TID and sells the land after the TID is approved, can the funds from the sale be returned to the municipality's general fund?",
      "A": "The portion of profits attributed to the TID are \"other revenues\" under s​ec. 66.1105(2)(f)1. , Wis.  Stats., and must be used to offset project costs. The remainder may be placed in the municipality’s general fund. The municipality should contact its attorney to review how to apply this law to the specific situation."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality buy and improve property with TIF funds and place revenue from the improved property's sale into the general fund?",
      "A": "No. A municipality cannot make a profit with TIF. It must use revenue from the sale of property purchased and improved with TIF funds to offset all other TID project costs."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality use TIF funds to reduce special assessments to property owners after the improvements are installed?",
      "A": "No. Reducing special assessments is not a TID eligible expense, under state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f) , Wis. Stats.). However, a municipality may combine a special assessment and TIF to pay for a particular project. That portion paid for with a special assessment is a non-project cost for the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is municipal-owned property included in the Tax Incremental District (TID) base value?",
      "A": "Since October 1, 2015, municipal-owned property is excluded from the base value, unless the purchase date is within one year before the municipality's TID creation resolution. In that case the property's assessed value before purchase is included in the base value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Which TID form do we use to enter the municipal-owned property?",
      "A": "Use Form PE-619 to enter the TID's municipal-owned parcel numbers and purchase date for each.  Enter a value when the purchase date was within one year before the municipality's adopted TID creation resolution date. Email this completed form to tif@wisconsin.gov with the other forms in the Base Value Workbook ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Which TID form do we use to enter property owned by another municipality?",
      "A": "- Form PE-619 – list any parcels owned by the municipality creating the TID\n- Form PE-608 – list any parcels owned by a different municipality, with the appropriate classification"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Should municipal-owned property be valued according to its exempt classification or at its value before it was purchased by the municipality?",
      "A": "- More than a year — if the property was purchased more than a year before the municipality's TID creation resolution, use the current property value, usually \"zero\"\n- ​ Within one year — if the property was purchased within one year before the municipality's TID creation resolution, use the assessed value prior to the purchase"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a territory addition amendment include the prior year value for municipal property purchased within a year prior to the municipal resolution?",
      "A": "Yes. A territory addition amendment creates a new part of the TID. The same guidelines apply to both a TID's creation and a territory addition amendment.\n- More than a year — if the property was purchased more than a year before the municipality's TID creation resolution, use the current property value, usually \"zero\"\n- Within one year — if the property was purchased within one year before the municipality's TID creation resolution, use the assessed value prior to the purchase"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What if the municipality purchased property within one year before the TID creation but the property was exempt before the purchase? What amount is included in the TID base value?",
      "A": "When the municipal-owned property was exempt before the purchase, no value for the property is included in the TID base. Enter the parcel with exempt classification and a value of zero on Form PE-619 of the Base Value Workbook . It is helpful to provide an explanation why the property was previously exempt (ex: it was owned by the school district or a non-profit entity)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In a mixed-use TID, how is municipal-owned exempt property (park/cemetery) included in the calculation when determining the 35% newly-platted residential limitation?",
      "A": "To determine the percentage, divide the TID's newly-platted residential property acreage by all real property acreage (including exempt property)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality purchase property and then create a TID for that property?",
      "A": "Yes. However, under state law (sec. 66.1105(5)(e) , Wis. Stats.), any property the municipality purchases within one year before the TID's creation must be treated as if the sale did not occur, unless the municipality can prove it acquired the property for a reason other than creating the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is an overlap?",
      "A": "An overlap is when the boundary of one Tax Incremental District (TID) covers another existing TID's boundaries. For more information, review state law (sec. 66.1105(10) , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does an overlap change the boundary of the overlapped TID?",
      "A": "No. The overlapped TID's boundaries are not affected by an overlap. The overlapped TID must still maintain whole parcels."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How are TID values affected by overlapping?",

The current value of the existing TID before the new overlapping TID was created becomes a frozen overlap value. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) establishes the frozen overlap value and includes it in the older TID's total current year value until the TID terminates.\nHere is a simplified example:\n- TID 1 was created in 2023 with a base value of $150,000\n- In 2024, the value for TID 1 is $300,000\n- TID 2 is created in 2024 and completely overlaps TID 1 in 2024\n- TID 2's base value is $300,000\n- The frozen overlap value for TID 1 is $300,000 (the value in the year it was overlapped) This value remains the same for the remainder of TID 1's life\n- This value remains the same for the remainder of TID 1's life\n- Any property value increase in 2025 or later generates increment value for TID 2"

      "A": "The current value of overlapped property, at the time it is overlapped, is the frozen overlap value. DOR establishes the frozen overlap value for the overlapped TID.\nExample:\n- TID 3 is partially overlapped by TID 4\n- TID 3's base value does not change\n- In the year of the overlap, the current full value of the overlapped property is $10,000\n- After DOR certifies TID 4, DOR includes the $10,000 frozen overlap value in TID 3's current value\n- DOR adds the $10,000 frozen value to TID 3's current value every year until the TID terminates\n- The frozen overlap value will not change Exception:  Additional property in TID 3 is overlapped\n- Exception:  Additional property in TID 3 is overlapped\n- The current values plus the frozen overlap value equals the total value used to calculate the TID increment (see table below)\n- In the below example, the total current year TID 3 value is $275,000 (property value $265,000 plus $10,000 frozen overlap value)\n- Current value ($275,000) minus base value ($150,000) equals a TID increment value of $125,000\nTID 3 - Value types TID 3 - Values Non-manufacturing Real Estate (RE) – not overlapped $210,000 Manufacturing RE – not overlapped $55,000 Frozen Overlap Value (for overlapped property) $10,000 Totals Total Current Year TID Value $275,000 2015 TID Base Value $150,000 TID Increment Value $125,000"

    {
      "Q": "Where can the municipality view the TID's frozen overlap value?",
      "A": "The municipality can view the value of the frozen overlap on the TID Statement of Changes report."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the municipality continue paying for projects in the overlapped parcels with increment from the existing TID?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality continues to receive tax increment funds for the overlapped TID to pay its project costs."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) use the parcel overlap value in determining the 12% value limit?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 66.1105(10)(c) , Wis. Stats.), DOR excludes this value from the new TID when determining compliance with the 12% limit. The parcel value is already included in the value increment for the existing TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For the parcels in the overlapped area, are both the new and old TID number shown on the assessment/tax roll?",
      "A": "No. On the assessment/tax roll, the overlapped (older) TID number is removed from the parcel and the overlapping (newer) TID number is added to the parcel. A parcel may only have one TID number on the assessment/tax roll."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the overlapping (newer) TID terminates and the overlapped (older) TID is still active, should the TID number be changed back to the overlapped TID?",
      "A": "No, do not put the older TID back on the overlapped parcels. The overlapped TID receives a frozen overlap value until it terminates. Putting the older TID number on the overlapped parcels may cause an incorrect current value for the overlapped TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Will the frozen overlap value of an overlapped TID be deleted if the overlapping TID is terminated?",
      "A": "No. Once a frozen overlap value exists for an overlapped TID, the frozen overlap value is included in the current year TID value until the overlapped TID terminates. The frozen overlap value for the overlapped TID does not change even if the overlapping TID terminates."
    },
    {
      "Q": "To subtract overlapped parcels, which TID does a municipality amend? The older TID or the newer TID?",
      "A": "To subtract overlapped parcels, the municipality must subtract the parcels from the TID currently shown on the assessment/tax roll. Generally, the newer TID is on the assessment/tax roll."
    },

    {
      "Q": "Will the frozen overlap value of an overlapped TID be reduced if overlapped parcels are subtracted from the overlapping TID?",
      "A": "No. Once a frozen overlap value exists for an overlapped TID, the frozen overlap value is included in the current year TID value until the overlapped TID terminates. The frozen overlap value does not change even if the overlapped parcels are subtracted from the overlapping TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a new TID completely overlaps an existing TID, does the overlapped TID still exist?",
      "A": "Yes. The overlapped TID remains active until the municipality adopts a termination resolution. Due to the frozen overlap value, the municipality may continue to receive tax increment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a distressed or severely distressed TID be overlapped by a newly created TID?",
      "A": "No. A newly created TID or an active TID that is adding parcels may not overlap a distressed or severely distressed TID."

    },
    {
      "Q": "Can parcels be added to the Tax Incremental District (TID) after the hearing notices are published?",
      "A": "Yes. The purpose of the public hearing is to receive/give input on the proposed boundaries of the district.  A municipality may add or remove parcels based on the hearing.  The hearing notice does not have to mention the proposed boundaries; however, including a general description of the area is helpful."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How much detail is needed in the boundary description provided to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR)?",
      "A": "A metes and bounds (legal boundary) description corresponding to the outer TID boundary is required. The boundary description must match the provided map.\nSee TID Checklist , Boundary and Map section."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why is a boundary description required in addition to the map?",
      "A": "State law (sec. 66.1105(4)(gm)1. , Wis. Stats.), requires the local legislative body to describe the TID boundaries. A metes and bounds description is necessary because parcel numbers and parcel boundaries may change over the TID's life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How much detail is needed in the TID map provided to DOR?",
      "A": "Map must be legible and:\n- Show the outer boundary of the TID\n- Show each parcel boundary\n- Label each parcel by tax number or designate a map identification number\n- Label all areas that do not have a parcel number (ex: streets, railroads, wetlands, or bodies of water)\n- Label the municipality or county boundaries if within the map view\n- Indicate the municipality name and TID number\n- Show the boundaries of the overlapped TID, when overlapping exists\nNote:\n- Each numbered parcel on the map must be listed on the Base Value Workbook Exception: Do not list road or railroad parcels with a parcel number that are only partially in the TID boundary\n- Exception: Do not list road or railroad parcels with a parcel number that are only partially in the TID boundary\n- Provide additional enlarged areas of the map, where boundaries or parcel numbers are too small to see clearly even when magnified\n- For a territory amendment - show the original TID area, added/subtracted parcels and updated boundary"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who is responsible for valuing and classifying a TID's land and buildings?",
      "A": "The local assessor and DOR manufacturing assessor are responsible for valuing the improvements and land based on state law and the Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual."
    },
    {
      "Q": "A TID must contain contiguous properties; however, can a municipality omit parcels from the TID's center?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality may omit parcels, as long as the TID boundaries remain contiguous. The TID map must clearly show the parcels are not part of the TID.  The legal description must be consistent with the map and describe the excluded area.​"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When two parcels are diagonal (kitty corner) from each other, is this contiguous?",
      "A": "Yes. Two parcels that are diagonal to each other are considered contiguous and can be included in the same TID. They may or may not have a road or railroad between them."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the TID crosses a highway, river or railroad track, is this contiguous?",
      "A": "Yes. This is contiguous if the highway, river or railroad tracks are continuously bounded on either side or both sides by TID parcels. A highway, river or railroad tracks alone cannot create contiguity.\nRailroad tracks, regardless of ownership, must be bounded by TID parcels."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the difference between railroad tracks and a railroad right-of-way?",
      "A": "There is no difference. Railroad tracks cannot create contiguity in a TID. The railroad tracks must be bounded on either side or both sides by TID parcels."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do we handle a road or railroad with a parcel number when completing the Base Value Workbook?",
      "A": "DOR treats roads and railroads the same way. If the road or railroad parcel is completely within the TID boundary, list the parcel number on the map and the value forms. If the road or railroad parcel is partially in the TID boundary, identify the road or railroad on the map and do not list the parcel number on the value forms."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a parcel (exempt or non-exempt) be partly in a TID?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(k) , Wis. Stats.), only whole parcels can be in a TID. Roads and railroads are an exception. Roads/railroads can only be included in a TID where they are bounded by TID parcels, whether they have a parcel number or not."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How can a municipality combine two parcels if one parcel is in the TID and the other parcel is outside the TID?",
      "A": "A TID must contain whole parcels. To combine parcels inside and outside the TID, a municipality must complete one of the following amendments:\n- Territory addition amendment — add the parcel that is out of the TID to the TID area. Its value is added to the TID base value.\n- Territory subtraction amendment — remove the existing parcel from the TID area. Its value is subtracted from the TID base value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If property owned by a utility company is included in a TID, is the property exempt?",
      "A": "Location of a property in a TID does not determine taxability. Generally, utility property is not subject to local taxation and pays a state tax. Contact DOR's Manufacturing and Utility Bureau for more information. Tax exempt property in a TID does not add to the base value and does not contribute to the value increment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How should a municipality indicate that wetlands are excluded from the TID?",
      "A": "The municipality may describe the boundaries around the wetland, or state that all wetlands are excluded at the end of the TID boundary's legal description."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can wetlands be used to make a TID contiguous?",
      "A": "Wetlands identified on a map under sec. 23.32 , Wis. Stats., must be excluded from a TID. When an entire parcel meets this definition of wetlands, it cannot be included in the TID.\nWhen only part of the parcel is wetland, the parcel can be used to establish TID contiguity. When planning a TID, consider requesting DOR review the map."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are \"lands proposed for newly platted residential use?\"",
      "A": "State law does not define the phrase \"lands proposed for newly platted residential use.\" A \"plat\" is a map of a subdivision. \"Newly platted\" refers to land that has not been previously subdivided or is currently subject to a replat as defined in sec. 236.02(11) , Wis. Stats. \"Residential\" commonly means relating to a place where people live.\nWhen reviewing a project plan, DOR considers the current use, or zoning, and the future use, or zoning, as indicators of whether an area consists of \"lands proposed for newly platted residential use.\" The plan should specify the parcels proposed for newly platted residential development.\nExample of lands proposed for newly platted residential use: When residential lots are platted on an undeveloped parcel of land, such as subdividing a farm field for housing."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What TID types can include costs for lands proposed for newly platted residential property?",
      "A": "Only TIDs declared as mixed-use type can incur project costs for lands proposed for newly platted residential property; the property may not exceed 35 percent by area of the TID.\nUnder state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)3. , Wis. Stats.), a municipality may only spend increment revenue on newly platted residential development in mixed-use TIDs if one of the following applies:\n- Density of the residential housing is at least three units per acre;\n- Residential housing is located in a conservation subdivision, as defined in sec. 66.1027(1)(a) , Wis. Stats.\n- Residential housing is located in a traditional neighborhood development, as defined in sec. 66.1027(1)(c) , Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is a road/highway included in the calculation determining the 35% residential use in mixed-use TIDs?",
      "A": "Include road/highway acreage in the total TID acreage but not the residential acreage. Divide the newly platted residential acreage, not including roads, by the total TID acreage to determine the newly platted residential percentage."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In a mixed-use TID, does the housing density calculation include roads and parks?",
      "A": "No. The housing density is based on all real property in the area designated as residential . This does not include roads or greenspace, but does include all housing whether subject to property tax or exempt."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For the 35% limit on lands proposed for newly platted residential use, is an assisted living building considered a residential use? Is multi-family housing?",
      "A": "Yes. Both an assisted living building and multi-family housing are considered residential use because the buildings are used for living purposes. The property still needs to be newly platted as part of the TID project plan to be subject to the 35% limit. This assumes that current or future zoning permits the assisted living or multi-family building."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a TID's boundaries be set based on something that will happen in the future?",
      "A": "No. The boundaries are determined based on the parcels when the TID is created. Territory amendments are possible to address parcel combinations, splits or annexations."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do projects within a TID have to follow local zoning?",
      "A": "Yes. TIF law does not change municipal zoning rules."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For mixed-use TIDs, does the land need to be zoned correctly before adopting the creation resolution?",
      "A": "No. The municipality does not need to complete zoning before it adopts the creation resolution. At least 50% of the land must be suitable (not necessarily zoned) for at least two of the following types: industrial, commercial or residential. There are no restrictions on the percentage between the types."
    },
    {
      "Q": "In an industrial TID, do all the parcels need to be zoned industrial?",
      "A": "No. To qualify as an industrial TID, at least 50% (by area) must be zoned industrial. Under state law (sec. 66.1105(4)(gm)5. , Wis. Stats.), the parcels that are zoned industrial when the TID is created (municipal resolution adoption date) must remain zoned industrial for the life of the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are eligible project costs?",
      "A": "Eligible project costs are those costs related directly to establishing and improving the Tax Incremental District (TID), including:\n- Capital development\n- Financing\n- Professional services (ex: consulting, accounting, legal services)\n- Organizational and administrative activities\n- Annual fees\n- Relocation\n- Creation of TID maps or architectural drawings\n- Utility or street construction directly associated with the TID\n- Removal or containment of lead contamination\n- Demolition or building repairs\n- Developer incentive (if municipality signs an agreement with the developer)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are project costs for an Environmental Remediation (ER) type TID limited to costs for remediating the environmental pollution?",
      "A": "No. The same list of eligible costs applies to an ER TID created after November 29, 2017, and other TID types created under sec. 66.1105, Wis. Stats.  Review sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1. , Wis. Stats. for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Do eligible costs include capitalized interest, other costs of issuing debt, and refinancing temporary debt for the Tax Incremental District (TID)?",
      "A": "Yes. These are eligible financing costs authorized in sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1.b. , Wis. Stats."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who determines if project costs are eligible?",
      "A": "It is the municipality's responsibility to determine if a project cost is eligible under state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1. & 2. , Wis. Stats.). The municipality should consult its attorney for assistance on whether a specific cost is eligible. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue does not review project costs or determine cost eligibility."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality reduce the costs of one project in a plan and use that amount for another project not in the plan?",
      "A": "No. However, the municipality may shift TIF funds to a new project if the municipality completes a project plan amendment to include the additional project."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality add projects without adding territory?",
      "A": "Yes. This is possible if the municipality completes a project plan amendment to add projects. Review the TIF Project Plan Amendments web page."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For mixed-use TIDs, are there restrictions on the project costs' percentage?",
      "A": "No. The costs for each area do not need to match the land type percentages. For example, a mixed-use TID may contain 90% ​of the project costs for industrial projects and 10% for commercial projects even though 10% of the land is industrial, and 90% is commercial."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What are non-project costs?",
      "A": "Non-project costs are expenses that are not eligible to be paid with TIF funds or public works projects that only partly benefit the TID. A municipality cannot use tax increments to pay these costs.\n- Public improvement made: Within the TID – that also benefits property outside the TID. The portion of the total project costs allocated to the properties outside the TID is a non-project cost. Outside the TID – that also benefits property within the TID. The portion of the total project costs allocated to the properties outside the TID is a non-project cost.\n- Within the TID – that also benefits property outside the TID. The portion of the total project costs allocated to the properties outside the TID is a non-project cost.\n- Outside the TID – that also benefits property within the TID. The portion of the total project costs allocated to the properties outside the TID is a non-project cost.\n- That portion of projects within the TID as part of the project plan implementation that are paid by user​ fees, grants, special assessments or revenues other than TIF increments\n- Project costs for construction or expansion of administrative buildings and general government operating expenses unrelated to the TID"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality include projects within a half-mile radius of the TID?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality may include projects outside the TID but within a half-mile radius if the projects are documented in the approved project plan. Only eligible costs within the half-mile radius can be paid for with TIF funds."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the half-mile radius determined? Is it measured from the TID's center or the outer boundary?",
      "A": "The half-mile radius is measured from the TID's outer boundary."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the municipality include projects within the TID's half-mile radius but outside the municipal boundary?",
      "A": "No, projects outside the TID must be within the municipal boundary (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1.n. , Wis. Stats.).\n- Within a half-mile of existing TID boundary\n- Within municipal limits\n- Eligible TIF expenditure\n- Detailed in the project plan\n- Approved by the JRB, as part of the TID creation or amendment process"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is a property tax refund an eligible TID project cost?",
      "A": "No. A property tax refund is not an eligible TID project cost and is not included as an approved cost in the project plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the municipality need to amend the project plan if the costs change, but the projects don't change?",
      "A": "No. Usually the project costs in the plan are estimates and may change over time due to inflation, supply, or other factors."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality need to complete all projects in the plan?",
      "A": "No. The project plan is a capital improvement plan (not an approved budget), therefore a municipality does not have to complete all projects. The municipality decides when and which project to complete. Many municipalities start individual projects as the funds become available (pay-as-you-go)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are there any projects outside the Tax Incremental District (TID) that can be paid with tax increments?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality may pay for projects within a half-mile radius of the TID if they are documented in the project plan and approved by the Joint Review Board. For more information, review state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1.n. , Wis. Stats.).\nAlso, the municipality may pay for a proportionate share of public improvements outside the TID with tax increments if the improvement serves property in the TID (ex: water tower, water or sewage lines, treatment plants). For more information, review state law (sec. 66.1105(2)(f)1.k. , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality need to amend a project plan if an unanticipated development occurs?",
      "A": "It depends on whether the development requires changes to the TID's planned projects. When a municipality wants to change the planned projects to support the new development, it must amend the plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How long does it take to amend a project plan?",
      "A": "It depends on how long it takes the municipality to assemble the information and hold the necessary meetings. Generally, it takes less time than creating a new TID because only one hearing notice is required and there is no required waiting period between the public hearing and the municipal resolution.\nSee the Tax Incremental District (TID) Checklist."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality amends a project plan, can the municipality incur costs for a newly platted residential development?",
      "A": "A municipality may only incur costs for a newly platted residential development for a mixed-use type TID.\nSee Parcels question 17 for additional information on development types allowed."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality need to conduct a new economic feasibility study when it amends a project plan?",
      "A": "Yes. If a municipality amends the plan, it must update the economic feasibility study in the project plan. See Guidelines for Project Plans ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If development not supported by TIF occurs, does the municipality need to amend the plan because this will change the economic feasibility study?",
      "A": "Any development in the TID, whether supported by TIF or not, generates increment the municipality can use to pay project costs. An increment increase could allow the municipality to pay costs sooner than anticipated in the plan's economic feasibility study. However, the municipality does not need to amend the plan solely to revise the economic feasibility study."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can the municipality add projects or costs to the plan after the public hearing notice is published?",
      "A": "Yes. The municipality may revise the project plan and costs any time before adopting the municipal resolution. The Joint Review Board must adopt a resolution approving the final project plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When can the municipality begin projects added to an amended project plan?",
      "A": "Except for planning costs, the municipality must complete the project plan amendment before using tax increments to pay for projects not in the project plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How many days before the public hearing does a municipality need to publish a Class 1 notice? A Class 2 notice?",
      "A": "When creating a TID — the municipality must publish a Class 2 notice in the newspaper for the public hearing. The Class 2 notice must be published once each week for two consecutive weeks with the last notice published at least seven days before the public hearing.\nWhen amending a TID — the municipality must publish a Class 1 notice in the newspaper at least seven days before the public hearing"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What must be included in a public notice?",
      "A": "The meeting notice must inform the public of the time, date, place, and subject matter of the meeting. A TID amendment notice must also include the purpose and cost of the amendment.\nFor assistance, see the sample notices on the TIF Public Notices web page."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the public hearing notice need to include a description of the proposed Tax Incremental District's (TID) outer boundary?",
      "A": "No. Under state law, the hearing notices do not have to include a legal description or parcel numbers; however, it may be helpful to include a small map or street locations to describe the area in the TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the public hearing notice need to include a list of the TID projects and costs?",
      "A": "For a TID creation, the notice should include a description of the planned projects but does not need to include individual costs.\nFor any TID amendment, the notice must include both the purpose and the total cost of the amendment (sec. 66.1105(4)(h)1. , Wis. Stats). ​Include in the cost, any additional eligible project costs such as capital development, financing, professional services, or allocations to another TID."
    },

Stats.), when creating a TID, a municipality must notify owners of property in the proposed TID that is identified as blighted or in need of rehabilitation/conservation work, at least 15 days before the public hearing.\nWhen adding parcels to an existing TID, a municipality must notify the owners of additional property identified as blighted or in need of rehabilitation/conservation work, at least 15 days before the public hearing.\nThe law does not specify how to provide the notification; however, sending by mail is the usual method."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is notification still required if the municipality owns the property identified as blighted or rehabilitation/conservation?",
      "A": "Yes. State law requires notification to all owners. The municipality should document the notice by creating a letter in the same format it notifies other owners. This letter does not need to be mailed; however, it must be retained in the municipal TID files."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a proposed TID is being created, do the adjoining parcel owners receive notification?",
      "A": "State law does not require the municipality to send letters notifying property owners outside a proposed TID boundary. However, the municipality must publish notices for the public hearing and Joint Review Board (JRB) meetings in a local newspaper.\nAfter the TID is created, any property development within the TID follows the approved project plan. If the plan requires changes to zoning, ordinances, or the city's master plan, then the municipality's procedures for making these changes apply."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Which taxing jurisdictions does a municipality need to notify of the public hearing?",
      "A": "The municipality must provide the public hearing notice to all overlying taxing jurisdictions with the power to levy taxes within the proposed TID, even if the taxing jurisdiction does not have a representative on the JRB.\nA special taxing district or a school district/county without the majority value in the TID does not have a representative on the JRB. However, the municipality must still provide those jurisdictions the public hearing notice before it is published."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does the municipality notify the overlying taxing jurisdictions of the public hearing?",
      "A": "Before January 1, 2025 - under sec. 66.1105(4)(e) , Wis. Stats., the municipality must send, by first class mail, the public hearing notice for a TID creation or amendment to the chief executive officer or administrator of all taxing jurisdictions with the power to levy taxes on property in the proposed TID.\nStarting January 1, 2025 - state law does not define the distribution method for municipal TIDs. For town TIDs created under sec. 60.85 Wis. Stats., the town must send, by first class mail, the public hearing notice for a TID creation or amendment to the chief executive officer or administrator of all taxing jurisdictions with the power to levy taxes on property in the proposed TID.\nThe municipality must provide the overlying taxing jurisdictions the public hearing notice before the notice is published and submit documentation to DOR showing this requirement was met."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does a municipality know what districts exist for the parcels in the TID?",
      "A": "The municipality should contact its assessor for this information. Review Taxation Districts with Underlying Taxing Jurisdictions for information on all existing taxation districts within each municipality."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the municipality need to notify a special district that does not levy taxes?",
      "A": "The municipality  must notify any special district with the power to levy taxes, even if the district chooses not to levy taxes."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does a municipality need to publish the Joint Review Board's (JRB) Class 1 notice?",
      "A": "A municipality must publish a Class 1 notice in a local newspaper at least five days before all JRB meetings. (sec. 66.1105(4m)(e) , Wis. Stats.). This includes JRB meetings to discuss TID creations, amendments, extensions, and the TID annual report review meeting."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality amend a TID plan without holding a public hearing?",
      "A": "No. State law (sec. 66.1105(4)(h)1. , Wis. Stats.), describes the amendment process and requires a public hearing."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality is amending a TID, is there a 14-day waiting period between the public hearing and the local legislative body approval?",
      "A": "No. The 14-day waiting period is only required when creating a TID; it does not apply to amending a TID. When amending a TID, the municipality can hold the public hearing and adopt a resolution approving the amendment on the same day."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality previously held a public hearing and JRB organizational meeting, but afterwards put a hold on creating a TID until a few years later, does the municipality need to hold another public hearing and JRB organizational meeting?",
      "A": "Under state law, there is no time limit between the public hearing/JRB's organizational meeting and adoption of the creation resolution. There is only the 14-day waiting period before adopting a resolution.\nWhile not required, it may be best for the municipality to start the process over. This promotes transparency and allows for updates to the project plan. The previous project plan, expenses and goals may no longer apply."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are the boundary TID type and plan described in the public hearing notice final?",
      "A": "No. The public hearing may result in possible changes to the boundary, TID type or project plan. The municipal resolution determines the TID's final details."
    },
    {
      "Q": "For a TID amendment, are the costs described in the public hearing notice final?",
      "A": "No. The municipality may make changes to the plan, including costs, after the public hearing. The municipality adopts a resolution to approve the final project plan."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does posting the public hearing or JRB notice at city hall meet TID requirements for notifying the public?",
      "A": "No. State law requires publishing the notice in a local newspaper."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What documents must a municipality provide DOR to demonstrate the notices were published correctly?",
      "A": "The municipality must provide a signed affidavit from the newspaper that confirms the publication dates and includes a copy of the actual notice. Sales receipts are not acceptable documentation of the publication dates."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the difference between a value increment and a tax increment?",
      "A": "Value increment – difference between the Tax Incremental District's (TID's) base value and current value. It is the property value that generates the tax increment.\nTax increment – taxes levied by all overlying taxing jurisdictions on the value between the TID's base value and current value. The municipality that maintains the TID receives the taxes and must use the funds to pay for the approved project costs."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who certifies the value increment annually?",
      "A": "The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) certifies the annual value increment by August 15 each year. DOR certifies the increment only if the municipality pays a $150 administrative fee for each active TID by April 15. If the fee is not paid, DOR will not certify the municipality's increment for that year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does the municipality receive its first tax increment on a new creation?",
      "A": "The date the municipality adopts the creation resolution determines when it will receive its first increment. The TID Creation Timeframes table explains the timing of the first tax increment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does residential development in a TID produce value increment?",
      "A": "Yes. All taxable property that increases a TID's value becomes part of the increment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If personal property is located within a TID, is the personal property value included in the TID base value? In the TID current value?",
      "A": "2023 Act 12 exempted personal property from taxation, effective January 1, 2024. Starting in 2024, a TID’s current year value does not include personal property.\nTIDs created in 2023 and before include taxable personal property in the base value. A municipality may request DOR remove the personal property value from a TID’s base value. Email the Personal Property Adjustment Workbook to tif@wisconsin.gov. DOR will review and adjust the base value. For more information review the TIF Base Value Adjustment due to Personal Property Exemption web page.\nTIDs created in 2024 and later do not include personal property in the base value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality received enough increment to pay the debt incurred for the district, can the excess increment be used for additional projects?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality may use excess increment for additional projects if the expenditure period has not expired; however, only projects in the approved plan may be paid with TIF funds. If the project is not in the approved plan, the municipality must complete a project plan amendment and email the required documents to tif@wisconsin.gov."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a TID terminates after April 15, is an increment still added to the tax levies in December?",
      "A": "Yes. If the municipality terminates a TID after April 15, DOR will certify a value increment for that year. The tax increment for that year must be levied and collected. See the TID Termination Timeframes table for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Should a municipality collect the entire final tax increment in the TID's last year if it is not all needed?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality must collect the entire final tax increment to maintain equal taxation. State law (sec 66.1105(6)(c) , Wis. Stats.), requires the municipality to return any surplus to the TID's overlying taxing jurisdictions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality choose not to levy the increment on the tax roll?",
      "A": "No. Wisconsin's constitution has a uniformity clause, which requires uniform property taxation. By not levying the increment, the taxpayers in that municipality would be taxed at a different rate (for school, technical college, or county) than the other taxpayers."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is the tax increment calculated using the tax rate?",
      "A": "Step a) First, a municipality must determine the tax rate per $1,000 of property value.\nExample: The tax rate is $23.73. This amount is then apportioned to the taxing jurisdictions for that municipality.\nTaxing Jurisdiction Tax Rate Percent of Total Rate County 3.81 16.05% Municipality 9.52 40.12% School District 10.36 43.66% Technical College 0.04 0.17% Total $23.73 100%\nStep b) Multiply the tax rate by the value increment DOR certifies to determine the actual dollars available to pay eligible project costs.\nExample: This is a TID with a 2020 creation year. Changes to the increment value or tax rate result in a different tax increment.\nYear Assessed Year Tax Increment Received Increment Value Tax Rate Percent Tax Increment 2020 2021 0 .02373 0 2021 2022 1,500,000 .02373 35,595 2022 2023 1,500,000 .02401 36,015 2023 2024 1,800,000 .02401 43,218\nEvery municipality with a TID must complete the Tax Increment Worksheet ( Form PC-202 ) each December to calculate the actual tax increment based on the municipality's levy amount. See the detailed example in the TIF Manual, How TIF Works ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) notify a municipality of its increment value?",
      "A": "Each year (on August 15 and October 1), DOR posts TIF reports that list each TID's value increment to our website.\nPosted reports:\n- Apportionment of County Levy (August 15)\n- TIF Value Limitation (August 15)\n- Statement of Changes (August 15)\n- Certification Report (October 1)"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How long are DOR reports available?",
      "A": "DOR maintains statewide TID reports for 7 years. All available reports are posted on our website. It is the municipality's responsibility to save information on its TIDs."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does a municipality terminate a Tax Incremental District (TID)?",
      "A": "The municipality must adopt a termination resolution when one of the following occurs:\n- All project costs have been recovered\n- TID reaches its maximum life or extended life date\n- Municipality decides to terminate the TID early for any other reason"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What should the municipality provide to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) when a TID terminates?",
      "A": "Within 60 days of adopting the termination resolution or by April 15, whichever is earlier:\n- Email tif@wisconsin.gov :​ Adopted TID Termination Resolution Completed Final TID Accounting Submission Date Agreement ( Form PE-223 )\n- Adopted TID Termination Resolution\n- Completed Final TID Accounting Submission Date Agreement ( Form PE-223 )\n- ​​Notify your assessor and county real property lister – provide a list of the property, which they use to remove the TID number from the tax/assessment roll.\nWithin 12 months of adopting the termination resolution:\n- Complete the Final Audit; save a copy in the Municipal TID records\n- Electronically file the Final Accounting Report (Form PE-110) using MyDORGov\n- Verify the TID number is removed from all property on the correct year's tax/assessment roll"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When filling out the Final TID Accounting Submission Date Agreement (Form PE-223), how does the municipal clerk determine the Final Accounting Submission date?",
      "A": "The Final Accounting Submission Date is the date when the municipality agrees to file the TID Final Accounting Report (PE-110). Before submitting this report, the municipality's Certified Public Accountant must complete the final audit. Contact the municipal accountant to determine when the final audit will be completed. Then complete the Final Accounting Submission Date. This due date must be within a year of the TID termination resolution."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the last year a municipality receives an increment for a terminated TID?",
      "A": "The date the municipality adopts the termination resolution determines the last year it receives an increment for that TID. For more details see the TID Termination Timeframes table."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality adopts a TID termination resolution, does the municipality need to pay DOR an administrative fee?",
      "A": "The answer depends on the date the local legislative body adopts the termination resolution:\n- On or before April 15 — municipality does not pay the administrative fee that year\n- After April 15 — municipality must pay the administrative fee that year"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality terminate an existing TID and then create another TID in the same year?",
      "A": "Yes.\n- Local legislative body must adopt the termination resolution before adopting the creation resolution for another TID\n- Municipality must remain below the 12% value limit after terminating a TID, to create another TID\n- Local legislative body can adopt a creation resolution for a new TID if the municipality remains below the 12% value limit (including the new TID)\n- Termination resolution for an existing TID can occur at any time in the same year"
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality terminates a TID, what happens if there are still debts?",
      "A": "The municipality is responsible for any remaining debt."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does the municipality divide excess funds among the overlying taxing jurisdictions?",
      "A": "According to state law (sec. 66.1105(6)(c) , Wis. Stats.), the municipality must return excess funds based on each taxing jurisdiction's portion of the total tax rate. DOR recommends basing the distribution on the most recent tax levy proportions without the tax increment. Column A of the Tax Increment Worksheet (PC-202) may be used for this calculation. Contact lgs@wisconsin.gov for further assistance."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How long does the municipality have to return the excess funds?",
      "A": "State law does not provide a specific deadline for distributing excess funds to other taxing jurisdictions. However, the TID's final audit must be completed within one year of the termination resolution. DOR recommends distributing the excess funds when the final audit is completed."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What if a municipality terminated a TID and has some outstanding expenses to pay before disbursing any extra funds to the other overlying tax jurisdictions?",
      "A": "It is the municipality's responsibility to determine proper administration in this situation. For example, a municipality may set up a temporary escrow account to cover the final expenses. This allows the municipality to complete its final audit."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality adopts a TID termination resolution and notified DOR, can it rescind the termination resolution so it can adopt an affordable housing resolution?",
      "A": "The answer depends on whether the termination deadline has passed and whether the TID has reached its maximum life. Municipalities must certify a TID as active or inactive by April 15 under state law (sec. 66.1105(6)(ae) Wis. Stats.). Both the termination and rescission must be in the same year based on this deadline. See the TID Termination Timeframes table.\nRescinding a termination resolution is possible when all items below apply:\n- TID has not reached its maximum life (or extended life) date\n- Municipality paid the administrative fee for the year to keep the TID active. If the fee is paid, DOR considers the TID active.\n- April 15 deadline has not passed; the TID number is still on the current year assessment/tax roll\nRescinding a termination resolution is not possible if any of the items below apply:\n- TID's maximum life (or extended life) date has passed\n- Administrative fee deadline has passed and the fee was not paid. Since the fee was not paid, DOR considers this TID terminated.\n- April 15 deadline has passed; the TID number is removed from the current year assessment/tax roll"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What happens to the TID's personal property aid and exempt computer aid when the TID terminates?",
      "A": "Effective with the 2022 payments, based on 2021 Act 61 , when a TID receiving these aid payments terminates, DOR transfers the payments to the overlying jurisdictions (ex: municipality, county, school district, technical college)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When does a municipality receive the one-time levy limit adjustment? How is this calculated?",
      "A": "In the year after the TID's termination year (see TID Termination Timeframes ), a municipality may use a one-time levy limit increase. The levy limit adjustment appears on the Levy Limit Worksheet the same year as the TID's termination year. For example, for a TID with a 2026 termination year, the 2026 Levy Limit Worksheet for taxes payable in 2027 reflects the increase.\nFor TIDs created before 2025, the increase percentage equals the TID's final increment value divided by the municipal TID equalized value without the TID increment, multiplied by 50%. The final increment and municipal equalized value used in the calculation are from the last year the TID had an equalized value (the year before the termination year).\nNote: If the municipality has more than one TID with the same termination year, the TID increment values are combined. A TID with a negative increment decreases the total increment used in the calculation.\nFor TIDs created in 2025 or after, the increase percentage equals 10% of the TID's new construction value divided by the municipal TID equalized value without the TID increment. An additional 15% of the TID's new construction value may be added if the TID terminates within 75% of the Joint Review Board's (JRB's) expected life.\nContact lgs@wisconsin.gov for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How many times can a municipality change the boundaries of a Tax Incremental District (TID)?",
      "A": "A municipality may complete a territory amendment to change TID boundaries up to four times during the TID's life. If a municipality completes a single amendment to add and subtract territory, it counts as one of the four territory amendments. Parcels within the TID must remain contiguous (geographically connected) when adding or subtracting parcels."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does a subtraction amendment differ from an addition amendment?",
      "A": "Subtraction amendment – decreases the number of parcels in the TID\n- Value of the removed parcels (at the time they were added to the TID) is subtracted from the base value\n- Value of personal property assessed in the TID (at the time the parcels were added to the TID) is also subtracted from the base value. This is possible if both the situations below apply:\n- The personal property became part of the TID prior to 2024 (which is the year personal property became tax exempt)\n- The municipality has not requested DOR adjust the TID's base value due to personal property exemption\nAddition amendment – increases the number of parcels in the TID\n- The value of the additional parcels (in the amendment year) is added to the existing base value"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does all property in a boundary amendment have to be in the same area?",
      "A": "No. As long as added or subtracted parcels are contiguous with the original TID parcels, the added or subtracted parcels do not have to be in the same area."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality adds territory to a TID, does the total area of the TID (original parcels and added parcels) have to meet the 50%  minimum property type based on its original TID type?",
      "A": "Yes. After a TID is created and declared a specific type, it must remain that type throughout its life. If a municipality adds parcels, 50% of the total TID area must meet the TID's original type. If a municipality subtracts parcels, 50% of the remaining property must meet the TID's original type.\nTo calculate the percentage when adding parcels:\n- New parcels added – use the current type designated\n- Existing parcels – use the type designated for each parcel when the TID was created\n- Recalculate the percentage of all parcels designated at the original TID type (blighted, industrial etc.). The percentage must be at least 50%.\nTo calculate the percentage when subtracting parcels:\n- Subtract the acreage of the removed parcels originally designated as the specific TID type (blighted, industrial, etc.) from the original total acreage\n- Recalculate the percentage of the remaining parcel acreage designated at that TID type. The percentage must be at least 50%."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What should the map and the metes and bounds (boundary legal description) show in a Territory Amendment?",
      "A": "Map – must show the full TID's boundary and identify the added or subtracted parcels. The new boundary must show that the entire TID remains contiguous. Review Parcels Common Question 4 for more information on map requirements.\nBoundary legal description – must be revised to describe the updated TID outer boundary of the full TID, including the necessary revisions to account for parcel changes made in the amendment."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality discuss multiple amendments (to update projects, add/subtract territory, allocate to another TID) at the same public hearing?",
      "A": "Yes. However, the municipality must describe each action in a separate statement in the public hearing notice.\nSee the sample Combined Public Hearing Notice and first JRB meeting – Amendment ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality complete a territory addition amendment and update the project plan with new projects at the same time?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality usually updates the project plan during a territory amendment to add projects in the new territory. The municipality can also update the project plan with projects that do not relate to the new territory.  In both cases, the municipality can complete and submit one set of forms to DOR.\nSee the TID Checklist for the required forms and documents."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When territory is added to a TID, does this change the base value of the existing parcels?",
      "A": "No. The base value of the existing parcels does not change; however, when territory is added, the new parcels' current value is added to the TID's existing base value.\nExample: TID 2 was created in 2021 with a base value of $150,000. In 2025, the municipality adds 10 parcels valued (as of January 1, 2025) at $45,000. The $150,000 existing base value plus the $45,000 value of additional parcels equals $195,000. In 2026, the TID's new base value is $195,000."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does adding territory affect the TID expenditure period?",
      "A": "No. Adding territory does not change the TID's expenditure period. All project costs (original and additional costs) must be incurred within five years before the TID's maximum life."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does a municipality need to notify owners of blighted property prior to an amendment hearing?",
      "A": "Yes. When adding parcels to a blighted or rehabilitation/conservation TID, the municipality must notify the owners of parcels being added and identified as blighted or rehabilitation/conservation 15 days before the public hearing."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality amend the boundaries of a distressed or severely distressed TID?",
      "A": "A municipality may complete a boundary amendment to subtract territory from an existing distressed or severely distressed TID; however, a municipality may not add territory to a distressed or severely distressed TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If the municipality adds territory to an existing TID, does the TID include the new territory's personal property and personal property value in the base?",
      "A": "No, personal property is exempt effective January 1, 2024. When amending a TID in 2024 or after, only the taxable real property added to the TID becomes part of the TID's new base value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality is over the 12% value limit, can the municipality add and subtract territory simultaneously?",
      "A": "If a municipality is over the 12% value limit, it can add and subtract territory in the same TID at the same time as long as the net change to the base value is negative. However, the value of the added and subtracted parcels is determined differently.\nValue of the:\n- Subtracted parcels – is the original value when the parcels entered the TID\n- Additional parcels – is the value as of January 1 of the amendment year\nSee Value Limit Common Question 9 for additional information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "A municipality is subtracting a parcel that did not exist when the TID was created. The parcel being subtracted was a portion of a larger parcel that was divided after the TID was created. How is the base value of the parcel being subtracted determined?",
      "A": "When the parcel was part of one larger original TID parcel, the assessor must determine the prorated value of the parcel at the time it was included in the TID. For the land value, generally, this is based on the percentage of the current parcel to the original parcel. For the building/improvements value (if any), it may depend on whether they were located on the portion being removed. Provide an explanation of how the assessor determined the values on the TID Territory Subtraction Workbook ."

    {
      "Q": "Are the procedures (ex: notices, public hearings, resolutions) for creating a town TID under state law (sec. 60.23, Wis. Stats.), different from those for a city or village?",
      "A": "No. The procedures are the same because the town chose to exercise all powers of a city, under sec. 66.1105, Wis. Stats. See the TID Checklist ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What additional requirements must a town meet compared to a city or village when creating a TID under sec. 60.23, Wis. Stats.?",
      "A": "There are three additional requirements:\n- Prior year equalized value — must be at least $500 million​\n- Prior year population — must be at least 3,500 based on the Wisconsin Department of Administration's most recent Annual Population Estimates\n- Sewer service — is or will be provided before use or operation of any improvements\nNote:\n- The prior year is the year before the town board adopts the creation resolution\n- The project plan should show that the town meets these requirements"
    },
    {
      "Q": "State law (sec.60.23(32)(f)2., Wis. Stats.) requires the town to select option (a), (b) or (c). What impact do these three options have on the project plan?",
      "A": "Option (a) — (sec. 60.23(32)(f)2.a. )\n- At least 51% of the public infrastructure improvement value must be financed by a private developer or entity\n- Development agreement is required to receive cash grants which will solely repay the developer or entity for public infrastructure costs\nOption (b) — (sec. 60.23(32)(f)2.b. )\n- Town expects all project costs to be paid within 90% of the TID's remaining life\nOption (c) — (sec 60.23(32)(f)2.c. )\n- Expenditures may be made only within the first half of the TID's remaining life\n- Joint Review Board can approve additional expenditures; however, the vote must be unanimous, and the expenditures cannot exceed the original expenditure period"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is debt service included in the timeframe for Option (b) or Option (c)?",
      "A": "Option (b) — the creation project plan must demonstrate the TID will have sufficient revenue to pay off debt and all project costs within 90% of the TID's maximum life. After all project costs are paid, the town must terminate the TID.\nOption (c) — the municipality may only take on project costs within the first half of the TID's remaining life. Debt payments may continue through the TID's maximum life."

    {
      "Q": "Does a town have to choose option (a), (b) or (c) each time it amends a TID, or do the options only apply when creating a TID?",
      "A": "A town must select an option (a, b, or c) when creating the TID, and document the selection in the project plan.  If the town completes an amendment, it must reconfirm the TID's original creation option or select a different option."

    {
      "Q": "What limit percentage affects a town?",
      "A": "12% — if the TID is created under sec. 60.23, Wis. Stats., the 12% limit is used because the town chose to exercise all powers of a city under sec. 66.1105, Wis. Stats.\n5% or 7% — if the TID is created under sec. 60.85, Wis. Stats., the 5% or 7% limit is used\nSee the Value Limit Common Questions for more information."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a town TID still be created under sec. 60.85, Wis. Stats.?",
      "A": "Yes. A town may create a TID under sec. 60.85, Wis. Stats. For more information, review the Town Creation web page."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the equalized value limit?",
      "A": "The equalized value limit is the maximum property value a municipality can have within Tax Incremental Districts (TIDs). It is calculated by adding the equalized value of the new TID's taxable property as of January 1 (of the creation or amendment year) and the value increment of all existing TIDs for that municipality (as of the municipal resolution date). This value cannot exceed 12% of the municipality's total equalized value (as of the municipal resolution date).\nSee state law (sec. 66.1105(4)(gm)4.c. , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What role do final equalized values (posted on August 15) have when calculating the 12% limit?",
      "A": "The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) updates municipal equalized values annually on August 15. The municipal TID creation (or amendment) resolution adoption date determines which year's increment value and municipal value to use in the value limit calculation. If the local legislative body resolution is adopted:\n- Before August 15 — use previous year's equalized value increment and municipal value\n- On or after August 15 — use current year's equalized value increment and municipal value\nReview the TIF Value Limitation Report to view increment value, municipal value, and the percentage calculation by year."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a Tax Incremental District (TID) has parcels in more than one county, is the value limit calculation separated by county?",
      "A": "No. The entire TID's full value is included in the value limit calculation. Values from both counties for the TID base, TID increment and municipal equalized value are combined when calculating the 12% limit."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When calculating the 12% limit for creating a TID or adding parcels to an existing TID, does the municipality include the increment for a terminated district?",
      "A": "No. The municipality does not include the terminated TID's increment value when calculating the 12% limit, as long as the municipality adopted the termination resolution before the creation or territory resolution."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Are overlapped parcel values included in the 12% limit calculation?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 66.1105(10)(c) , Wis. Stats.), the value of overlapped parcels are not included in the 12% limit calculation. The overlapped parcel values are already included in the increment for the existing TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality create a new TID with a zero base value if the municipality's existing TIDs already exceed the 12% limit?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 66.1105(4)(gm)4.c. , Wis. Stats.), a new TID or territory addition cannot be approved if the municipality already exceeds the 12% limit. A new TID cannot be created even if the new TID completely overlaps an existing TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "If a municipality is creating multiple TIDs in the same year, and all the TIDs are under 12% individually but collectively exceed the limit, can the TIDs be created?",
      "A": "Yes. Each submission stands alone. As long as each TID (created/amended) in the same year meets the 12% limit individually, the TIDs can be created/amended. See state law (sec. 66.1105(4)(gm)4.c. , Wis. Stats.)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the 12% limit apply to territory amendments (adding/subtracting parcels), or does it only apply when a municipality is creating a new Tax Incremental District (TID)?",
      "A": "The 12% limit applies to new TID creations (except designated Environmental Remediation (ER) TIDs) and TID amendments adding parcels. The value limit calculation is part of the required findings in the municipal resolution. The 12% value limit does not apply when a municipality is subtracting parcels from a TID."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality amends an existing TID to add parcels, how is the 12% limit calculated?",
      "A": "The equalized value of the added parcels only (as of January 1 of the amendment year) plus the value increment of all existing TIDs (as of the municipal resolution date), divided by the municipal equalized value (as of the municipal resolution date) equals the limit percentage. This limit cannot exceed 12%​."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality amends an existing TID to add and subtract parcels, how does the 12% limit apply?",
      "A": "If a municipality completes an amendment that adds and subtracts parcels at the same time, the base value of the added and the subtracted parcels are combined. The resulting value is used in the value limit calculation. Subtracted parcels use the value from the year they entered the TID. Added parcels use the value as of January 1 of the amendment year.\nExample 1: A municipality adds one parcel with a value of $100,000 and subtracts one parcel that had a value of $50,000 when it entered the TID. The combined value is an addition of $50,000. The $50,000 total is used in the 12% value limit calculation.\nExample 2: A municipality adds one parcel with a value of $50,000 and subtracts one parcel that had a value of $100,000 when it entered the TID. Because the combined value is a subtraction of $50,000, the amendment is not required to meet the 12% value limit."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can a municipality amend a project plan to add projects when the municipality is over the 12% limit?",
      "A": "Yes. A municipality can amend the project plan to add projects when the municipality is over the 12% limit. The 12% limit only applies when a TID is created or parcels are added."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When a municipality amends a TID using simultaneous creation and subtraction, how does the 12% limit apply?",
      "A": "Under state law (sec. 66.1105(17) , Wis. Stats.), a municipality may complete a simultaneous creation and subtraction amendment without including the 12% finding in the resolution. The municipality must submit the creation and subtraction amendment together and include a fair market value appraisal for each. The appraisals must show that the property value being removed in the subtraction amendment equals or exceeds the amount needed for the proposed TID to comply with the 12% limit.\nA municipality may only complete a simultaneous creation and subtraction if it has no other active TID created using this option."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the 12% value limit apply to Town TIDs created under state law (sec.60.85, Wis. Stats.)?",
      "A": "No. Under state law (sec. 60.85(3)(h)5.d. , Wis. Stats.), the limits are different. A town can only create a TID if it meets the 5% or 7% limit:\n5% limit — the district's equalized value plus the value increment of all existing districts in the town cannot exceed 5% of the town's total equalized value\n7% limit — the district's equalized value plus the current equalized value of all existing districts in the town cannot exceed 7% of the town's total equalized value"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does the 12% limit apply to Environmental Remediation (ER) TIDs created under state law (sec.66.1105, Wis. Stats.)?",
      "A": "Yes. However, the municipality can designate one ER TID created under sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats., as excluded from the 12% limit.\nThe municipality cannot change this designation to another ER TID. After the designated ER TID terminates, the municipality may designate another ER TID created under sec. 66.1105 , Wis. Stats., as excluded from the value limit."
