    "A": "Before swearing in the property owner, the BOR clerk should ask the property owner to submit a properly completed form. If the property owner refuses to complete the entire form, the BOR should conduct a pre-hearing and determine it will not hear the case. Under state law (sec. 70.47(7) , Wis. Stats.), a property owner must submit a written objection, complete any required forms, and provide stated valuations of the property in question. The BOR should not issue a determination notice. When the value being appealed is based on a market value class, case law is well​-established on the necessity of the appellant providing an opinion of value on the objection form. If the appeal is of a non-market value class, the clerk should ask for the approximate acres and an estimate of the correct assessed value of those acres.\nBefore swearing in the property owner, the BOR clerk should ask the property owner to submit a properly completed form.

    "A": "Unlike  the Lottery and Gaming Credit, the First Dollar Credit is applied equally to  each installment.\nCalculating a single payment (payment in full)  amount:\nExample: If there is a $31.95 First  Dollar Credit, $15.98 credit is applied to the first payment and $15.97 to the second  payment under a  two payment plan\nTwo calculation methods:\n- To determine the total amount​ due, subtract the Lottery and Gaming  Credit, and the First Dollar Credit from the net tax (net of School Levy Tax  Credit) and then add the amount of any special assessments and special charges  and special taxes (PFC, MFL, Occupational)\n- Under an installment plan, when calculating the tax amount due for  each installment, apply the First Dollar Credit equally across all the  installments\n- First method Subtract the First Dollar Credit from the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit), and then divide the  amount by the number of installments offered (two in the example above) to  determine the amount due for the second and subsequent installments For the first installment amount, you must subtract the Lottery  and Gaming Credit from the same amount calculated for the second installment  and then add the amount of any special assessments, special charges and special  taxes (PFC, MFL, and Occupational) Note: Depending  on the amounts of any special assessments, special charges and special taxes  and whether a Lottery and Gaming Credit is available for this parcel, the  amount due for the first installment may be greater than or less than the second  and subsequent installment amounts\n- Subtract the First Dollar Credit from the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit), and then divide the  amount by the number of installments offered (two in the example above) to  determine the amount due for the second and subsequent installments\n- For the first installment amount, you must subtract the Lottery  and Gaming Credit from the same amount calculated for the second installment  and then add the amount of any special assessments, special charges and special  taxes (PFC, MFL, and Occupational)\n- Note: Depending  on the amounts of any special assessments, special charges and special taxes  and whether a Lottery and Gaming Credit is available for this parcel, the  amount due for the first installment may be greater than or less than the second  and subsequent installment amounts\n- Second method Using two separate calculations, divide both the First Dollar  Credit and the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit) by the number of  installments. Take the results of dividing the net tax by the number of  installments, add any special charges, subtract the Lottery and Gaming Credit,  and subtract the First Dollar amount determined by dividing the allowable First  Dollar Credit by the number of installments. The second and subsequent installments would be the amount of the  net tax divided by the number of installments less the allowable First Dollar  Credit divided by the number of installments. Extra cents can be applied to  either the first or last installment.\n- Using two separate calculations, divide both the First Dollar  Credit and the net tax (net of School Levy Tax Credit) by the number of  installments.

Since the entire Lottery and Gaming Credit is applied to the first  installment (to the extent of the total tax due on the first installment), the  Lottery and Gaming Credit (if applicable) should always be applied to the taxes  due before the First Dollar Credit.

    "Q": "Is maple sap gathering considered an agricultural activity, and if so, how should this type of land be assessed?",
    "A": "By administrative rule, maple sap gathering is a qualifying agricultural use since the NAICS includes maple sap gathering as a crop production activity. Land devoted primarily to maple sap gathering in an area of maple trees tapped during the production season before the assessment date of January 1 and not in a use incompatible with agricultural use on January 1, is classified as agricultural and assessed at its use value.\nThe agricultural classification law does not have a minimum acreage size. Small acreages can qualify for agricultural classification if they are primarily used for agricultural purposes.\nQualifying acres must be tapped in the previous production season and be considered primarily engaged in maple sap gathering. Producers in the business generally follow industry standards for tapping trees. Producers following industry standards decide to tap maple trees within a mixed species woods when the density of maple trees is enough to make the use economically feasible. It is estimated that in a mixed-species stand of woods, a low to average quality tract has 20 tapped trees per acre whereas 30-40 tapped trees per acre is considered a high-quality stand in Wisconsin. Acres within a forest sufficiently tapped based on the industry standards qualify for agricultural classification, whereas areas within a forest with no tapping or minimal tapping do not qualify.\nThis effectively disqualifies an activity that is occasionally and minimally tapping large areas and claiming the entire acreage qualifies for agricultural purposes.",

The parcel had new construction during 2023. Three additional agricultural acres were converted to site acres, and the improvement's highest and best use changed to residential. The assessor did not discover the changes until after the 2024 assessment was completed. The 2024 taxes reflected the value of only the original \"other\" site and improvements from 2023. For the January 1, 2025 assessment, the parcel was re-classified as residential, with a significantly higher improvement value. Does a conversion charge apply?",
    "A": "Yes. When a new construction assessment is missed on a parcel with an existing improvement assessment, the assessor can add the assessed value of the new construction to the following year's assessment roll as omitted property. The improvements must be obvious, tangible, defendable, and measurable. The new improvement value should be entered in a special section of the assessment roll for omitted property. Since the change in use from agricultural to residential is first reflected on the 2025 assessment roll, it is recommended that the conversion charge be issued after BOR, allowing the property owner an opportunity to challenge the change in classification reflected on the roll. The conversion charge amount should be based on the year the actual change took place, in this case 2024 (which should have been when the residential classification was placed on the roll).",

    "A": "When a TID is created, the municipality and other taxing jurisdictions agree to support their normal operations from the existing tax base within the district. Property taxes for the school, county, technical college, and municipality are based on the taxable value of the TID at the time it is created.\nThe municipality funds development through the increases to the property values in the TID.  The taxes on the TID value increment (the difference between the TID's current value and the TID's base value), results in additional revenues collected for the district's fund. The municipality must use the funds to pay eligible TID costs. When costs are paid and the municipality closes the TID, the increased tax base is shared with all taxing jurisdictions.\nThe State of Wisconsin does not collect or pay tax increments to municipal governments.\nWhen a TID is created, the municipality and other taxing jurisdictions agree to support their normal operations from the existing tax base within the district.

    "A": "In the year after the TID's termination year (see TID Termination Timeframes ), a municipality may use a one-time levy limit increase. The levy limit adjustment appears on the Levy Limit Worksheet the same year as the TID's termination year. For example, for a TID with a 2026 termination year, the 2026 Levy Limit Worksheet for taxes payable in 2027 reflects the increase.\nFor TIDs created before 2025, the increase percentage equals the TID's final increment value divided by the municipal TID equalized value without the TID increment, multiplied by 50%. The final increment and municipal equalized value used in the calculation are from the last year the TID had an equalized value (the year before the termination year).\nNote: If the municipality has more than one TID with the same termination year, the TID increment values are combined. A TID with a negative increment decreases the total increment used in the calculation.\nFor TIDs created in 2025 or after, the increase percentage equals 10% of the TID's new construction value divided by the municipal TID equalized value without the TID increment. An additional 15% of the TID's new construction value may be added if the TID terminates within 75% of the Joint Review Board's (JRB's) expected life.\nContact lgs@wisconsin.gov for more information.\nIn the year after the TID's termination year (see\nTID Termination Timeframes\n), a municipality may use a one-time levy limit increase.

    "A": "If a municipality completes an amendment that adds and subtracts parcels at the same time, the base value of the added and the subtracted parcels are combined. The resulting value is used in the value limit calculation. Subtracted parcels use the value from the year they entered the TID. Added parcels use the value as of January 1 of the amendment year.\nExample 1: A municipality adds one parcel with a value of $100,000 and subtracts one parcel that had a value of $50,000 when it entered the TID. The combined value is an addition of $50,000. The $50,000 total is used in the 12% value limit calculation.\nExample 2: A municipality adds one parcel with a value of $50,000 and subtracts one parcel that had a value of $100,000 when it entered the TID. Because the combined value is a subtraction of $50,000, the amendment is not required to meet the 12% value limit.\nIf a municipality completes an amendment that adds and subtracts parcels at the same time, the base value of the added and the subtracted parcels are combined.
